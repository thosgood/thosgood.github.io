## Todo

### Major

- links like `/blog/2022/02` should work
- pagination for blog

### Minor
- font +/- button next to light/dark (in posts)
- footnotes should also display on hover (in posts)
- lots of blank spaces after `<span class="i">See all parts of this series:</span>` for some reason?
- replace all links to internal blog posts with some nanoc thing instead of hard-coding them
