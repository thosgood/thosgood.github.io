## Todo

- remove `.html` from blog post entries
    + you can just change the compile rule for `/blog/*.md` in `Rules`, but then all the `post.path` calls in various templates don't work?
- font +/- button next to light/dark (in posts)
- footnotes should also display on hover (in posts)
- pagination for blog
- lots of blank spaces after `<span class="i">See all parts of this series:</span>`
