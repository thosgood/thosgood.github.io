## Todo

- colour schemes on blog posts
    + rather than changing individual style values, instead activate/deactivate a .css file? that way we don't have to worry about how to change things back to how they originally were?
        * this would fix the link hover problem...
    + make buttons look nicer
- fix footnote return link arrows (vertically centred?)
- finish TOC in posts
    + h2 level?
- blog!
    + **pagination**
        * see /lib/pagination_helper.rb
    + posts
        * turn footnotes into sidenotes Ã  la Tufte?
            - or scrolling TOC in the margin?
        * full-width images
    + strip any footnotes from the previews
- _eventually_, https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/nanoc-items-performance.html
