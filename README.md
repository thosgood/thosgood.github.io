## Todo

### Major

- structure of `content/` directory changed to mirror blogdown
    + i.e. posts are just an `index.md` file inside a `YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` directory
- links like `/blog/2022/02` should work
- pagination for blog
- [rss feed](https://dev.to/npras/building-rss-feeds-for-static-sites-built-with-nanoc-2ihm)

### Minor
- font +/- button next to light/dark (in posts)
- footnotes should also display on hover (in posts)
- lots of blank spaces after `<span class="i">See all parts of this series:</span>` for some reason?
