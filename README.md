## Todo

- **big blog overhaul**
    + expandable "see more"
        * would show the excerpt that used to show
    + turn the whole div (title + underline + date) into one clickable `a` tag
    + footnotes in posts should work when you hover over them too
- fix the massive amounts of blank lines inserted before the automated "see all parts" thing?
- colour schemes on blog posts
    + rather than changing individual style values, instead activate/deactivate a .css file? that way we don't have to worry about how to change things back to how they originally were?
        * this would fix the link hover problem...
    + make buttons look nicer
    + actually, have a dark mode/colour scheme thing in the header, or somewhere that works globally (**i.e. for every page on the site**)
    + **do this how bookdown does it: just toggle the class of `body`**
- finish TOC in posts
    + h2 level?
- _eventually_, https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/nanoc-items-performance.html
