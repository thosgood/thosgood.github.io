I have just come back from CT2019 in Edinburgh, and it was a fantastic week. There were a bunch of really interesting talks, and I had a chance to meet some lovely people. I also got to tell people about [`#math.CT:matrix.org`](https://www.matrix.to/#/#math.CT:matrix.org), and so hopefully that will start to pick up in the not-too-distant future.

In no particular order, and with many glaring omissions, here are the slides from some of the talks that I really enjoyed:
