TI"©!Finally, I find myself with enough motivation to start writing the last part to this series. It's been a while, but hopefully nobody has actually been waiting... This is where we will finally see some of the exciting applications of (co)ends, including tensor products, geometric realisation, and Day convolution. One reason I've got around to writing this post is because coends (or, really, cowedges) appeared to me recently in a tweet about Stokes' theorem, which I found pretty neat indeed --- more details can be found in [this post](/blog/2019/09/04/stokes-coend.html).

For a refresher on all the definitions, you can check out the two previous parts in this series (the links are at the top), because we're just going to dive right in.

## Tensor products

Let $$\colon\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{D}$$ and $$G\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$$ be $$\mathcal{V}$$-functors. Then we define their _tensor product_ to be, **if it exists**, the coend

$$F\otimes_\mathcal{C}G = \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c)\otimes G(c).$$

As before, we have a non-enriched definition: whenever $$\mathcal{D}$$ has **all coproducts**, we can define

$$F\otimes_\mathcal{C}G = \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c)\cdot G(c)$$

where $$S\cdot d=\coprod_{s\in S}d$$ for any set $$S$$ and any object $$d\in D$$.

### Examples

- Consider a ring $$R$$ as a one-object $$\mathsf{Ab}$$-enriched. Then a right $$R$$-module gives an additive functor $$R^\mathrm{op}\to\mathsf{Ab}$$, and a left $$R$$-module gives an additive functor $$R\to\mathsf{Ab}$$. Then their tensor product, as $$\mathsf{Ab}$$-enriched functors, coincides with their usual tensor product as $$R$$-modules.

    This example is actually really linked to the theory of _profunctors_, which we will talk about below, but have already talked about [in a previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-14-cauchy-completion-and-profunctors %}#categorically).
- The co-Yoneda lemma $$F \cong \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}(-,c)\otimes F(c)$$ can now just be written as
 
    $$F\cong F\otimes_\mathcal{C}„Çà$$

    where $$„Çà\colon\mathcal{C}\to\widehat{\mathcal{C}}$$ is the Yoneda embedding.

    This lets us state the powerful adage, that "representable functors generalise free modules. To see what this might mean, we state the co-Yoneda lemma applied to a representable functor, as well as a basic theorem about tensor products of free modules, and leave the drawing of connections between the two to the interested reader:

    $$\begin{aligned}
        \operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,c)\otimes_\mathcal{C}F &\cong F(c)\\
        R^n\otimes_R M &\cong M^n.
    \end{aligned}$$

    Suggestive, right?
- Geometric realisation of a simplicial set $$X$$ can also be expressed as a tensor product. If we write $$\vert-\vert\colon\Delta\to\mathsf{Top}$$ to mean the functor that sends $$[n]$$ to the topological $$n$$-simplex, then we can write the geometric realisation $$\vert X\vert$$ of $$X$$ as

    $$\vert X\vert\cong X\otimes_\Delta\vert-\vert.$$

## Day convolution

As a motivation for the definition of Day convolution, we first recall the classical notion of convolution (albeit phrased in a more categorical language). Consider $$\mathbb{N}$$ as a **discrete** category with addition as a monoidal product. Let $$F,G\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathsf{Set}$$ be functors, which we can think of as _graded sets_. Then their _convolution_ $$(F*G)\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathsf{Set}$$ is defined by

$$\begin{aligned}
(F*G)(n) &= \sum_{i+j=n} F(i)\otimes G(j)\\
&= \sum_{i,j=1}^n F(i)\otimes G(j)\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathbb{N}(n,i+j)
\end{aligned}$$

where the second equality follows from the fact that $$\mathbb{N}$$ is discrete. It might seem like an excessively abstract way of writing some Kronecker delta function, but it is exactly the thing that makes this definition easy to abstractify and generalise.

So now let $$F,G\in\widehat{\mathcal{C}}=[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V}]=\mathsf{PrSh}_\mathcal{V}(\mathcal{C})$$ (or whichever other notation you most like that says that $$F$$ and $$G$$ are $$\mathcal{V}$$-valued presheaves). Then we define their _Day convolution_ $$(F*G)\in\widehat{\mathcal{C}}$$ by

$$(F*G)(c) = \int^{x,x'\in\mathcal{C}} F(x)\otimes G(x')\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,x\otimes x')$$

or, if you _really_ like tensor-product notation more than coend notation, by

$$(F*G)(c) = (F\otimes G)\otimes_{\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}}\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-\otimes-).$$

As I already mentioned in my [post about profunctors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-14-cauchy-completion-and-profunctors %}), there is a notion of Cauchy completion for presheaves. Something that I often heard say is that the presheaf category _itself_ is the 'free cocompletion' of the original category. There are a bunch of ways of explaining what this means, but my favourite 'proof' is using Day convolution and the co-Yoneda lemma, to show that the Yoneda embedding $$„Çà\colon\mathcal{C}\to\widehat{\mathcal{C}}$$ is **monoidal**:

$$\begin{aligned}
    &\big( \operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x)*\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x') \big)(c)\\
    \cong &\int^{y,y'\in\mathcal{C}}\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(y,x)\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(y',x')\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,y\otimes y')\\
    \cong &\int^{y\in\mathcal{C}}\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(y,x)\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,y\otimes x')\\
    \cong &\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,x\otimes x')
\end{aligned}$$

where the first isomorphism is by definition, and the last two are by co-Yoneda. That is,

$$\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x)*\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x') \cong \operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x\otimes x').$$

That is, _the Yoneda embedding is a (strong) monoidal functor_

$$(\mathcal{C},\otimes_\mathcal{C},I)\hookrightarrow(\widehat{\mathcal{C}},*,„Çà(I)).$$

Further, if $$\mathcal{C}$$ is small, then there is an internal hom on $$\widehat{\mathcal{C}}$$ which makes it _closed_.

Finally, as a fun little fact, which I used at some point in one of my masters theses,[^2] whenever $$\mathcal{C}$$ is small and symmetric, (commutative) monoid objects in the enriched-presheaf category (with Day convolution) are equivalent to (symmetric) lax monoidal functors from $$\mathcal{C}$$ to $$\mathcal{V}$$.

### Monoid algebra

Remembering all that we've said above about free modules, and how Day convolution is basically the presheaf version of the tensor product from the original category, I would like to repeat some of what [Alexander Campbell](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~alexc/) wrote in response to a [question I asked about Day convolution](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1650786/day-convolution-intuition) during the writing of my masters thesis.

There is a beautiful formal analogy between Day convolution and monoid algebra, which takes the following form:

| monoid algebra | Day convolution |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| set | category |
| monoid | monoidal category |
| ring $$R$$ | monoidally cocomplete[^1] category |
| $$R$$-module | cocomplete $$\mathcal{V}$$-category |
| $$R$$-algebra | monoidally cocomplete $$\mathcal{V}$$-category |
| free $$R$$-module $$R^{(X)}$$ on a set $$X$$ | free cocomplete $$\mathcal{V}$$-category $$\widehat{\mathcal{C}}$$ on a category $$\mathcal{C}$$ |
| free $$R$$-module $$R^{(X)}$$ on a monoid $$M$$ with the convolution product | free monoidally cocomplete $$\mathcal{V}$$-category $$\widehat{\mathcal{A}}$$ on a monoidal category $$\mathcal{A}$$ with Day convolution |
{:.ba}

## Profunctors

Just to have my obligatory "here is something that I don't understand" that all of my posts seem to have, I wrote down in my notes (only a few weeks ago) the following sentence

    profunctors! composition is via coends
    and this looks like ‚àÉ for composition of relations

I have a vague idea of what this means: when we compose relations we do it 'by existence', in that

$$SR(x,y)\iff\exists t\text{ s.t. }R(x,t)\wedge S(t,y)$$

and this somehow looks like a coend, but I have no idea (nor, really, the time (nor, really, the skill) to properly think about) how to make this formal. Any ideas?

    <p>This example is actually really linked to the theory of <em>profunctors</em>, which we will talk about below, but have already talked about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-14-cauchy-completion-and-profunctors %}#categorically">in a previous post</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The co-Yoneda lemma <script type="math/tex">F \cong \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}(-,c)\otimes F(c)</script> can now just be written as</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">F\cong F\otimes_\mathcal{C}„Çà</script>

    <p>where <script type="math/tex">„Çà\colon\mathcal{C}\to\widehat{\mathcal{C}}</script> is the Yoneda embedding.</p>

    <p>This lets us state the powerful adage, that ‚Äúrepresentable functors generalise free modules. To see what this might mean, we state the co-Yoneda lemma applied to a representable functor, as well as a basic theorem about tensor products of free modules, and leave the drawing of connections between the two to the interested reader:</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
      \operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,c)\otimes_\mathcal{C}F &\cong F(c)\\
      R^n\otimes_R M &\cong M^n.
  \end{aligned} %]]></script>

    <p>Suggestive, right?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Geometric realisation of a simplicial set <script type="math/tex">X</script> can also be expressed as a tensor product. If we write <script type="math/tex">\vert-\vert\colon\Delta\to\mathsf{Top}</script> to mean the functor that sends <script type="math/tex">[n]</script> to the topological <script type="math/tex">n</script>-simplex, then we can write the geometric realisation <script type="math/tex">\vert X\vert</script> of <script type="math/tex">X</script> as</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert X\vert\cong X\otimes_\Delta\vert-\vert.</script>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Day convolution</h2>

<p>As a motivation for the definition of Day convolution, we first recall the classical notion of convolution (albeit phrased in a more categorical language). Consider <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}</script> as a <strong>discrete</strong> category with addition as a monoidal product. Let <script type="math/tex">F,G\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathsf{Set}</script> be functors, which we can think of as <em>graded sets</em>. Then their <em>convolution</em> <script type="math/tex">(F*G)\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathsf{Set}</script> is defined by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
(F*G)(n) &= \sum_{i+j=n} F(i)\otimes G(j)\\
&= \sum_{i,j=1}^n F(i)\otimes G(j)\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathbb{N}(n,i+j)
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>where the second equality follows from the fact that <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}</script> is discrete. It might seem like an excessively abstract way of writing some Kronecker delta function, but it is exactly the thing that makes this definition easy to abstractify and generalise.</p>

<p>So now let <script type="math/tex">F,G\in\widehat{\mathcal{C}}=[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V}]=\mathsf{PrSh}_\mathcal{V}(\mathcal{C})</script> (or whichever other notation you most like that says that <script type="math/tex">F</script> and <script type="math/tex">G</script> are <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-valued presheaves). Then we define their <em>Day convolution</em> <script type="math/tex">(F*G)\in\widehat{\mathcal{C}}</script> by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(F*G)(c) = \int^{x,x'\in\mathcal{C}} F(x)\otimes G(x')\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,x\otimes x')</script>

<p>or, if you <em>really</em> like tensor-product notation more than coend notation, by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(F*G)(c) = (F\otimes G)\otimes_{\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}}\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-\otimes-).</script>

<p>As I already mentioned in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-14-cauchy-completion-and-profunctors %}">post about profunctors</a>, there is a notion of Cauchy completion for presheaves. Something that I often heard say is that the presheaf category <em>itself</em> is the ‚Äòfree cocompletion‚Äô of the original category. There are a bunch of ways of explaining what this means, but my favourite ‚Äòproof‚Äô is using Day convolution and the co-Yoneda lemma, to show that the Yoneda embedding <script type="math/tex">„Çà\colon\mathcal{C}\to\widehat{\mathcal{C}}</script> is <strong>monoidal</strong>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
    &\big( \operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x)*\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x') \big)(c)\\
    \cong &\int^{y,y'\in\mathcal{C}}\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(y,x)\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(y',x')\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,y\otimes y')\\
    \cong &\int^{y\in\mathcal{C}}\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(y,x)\otimes\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,y\otimes x')\\
    \cong &\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(c,x\otimes x')
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>where the first isomorphism is by definition, and the last two are by co-Yoneda. That is,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x)*\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x') \cong \operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(-,x\otimes x').</script>

<p>That is, <em>the Yoneda embedding is a (strong) monoidal functor</em></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\mathcal{C},\otimes_\mathcal{C},I)\hookrightarrow(\widehat{\mathcal{C}},*,„Çà(I)).</script>

<p>Further, if <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> is small, then there is an internal hom on <script type="math/tex">\widehat{\mathcal{C}}</script> which makes it <em>closed</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, as a fun little fact, which I used at some point in one of my masters theses,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup> whenever <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> is small and symmetric, (commutative) monoid objects in the enriched-presheaf category (with Day convolution) are equivalent to (symmetric) lax monoidal functors from <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> to <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>.</p>

<h3>Monoid algebra</h3>

<p>Remembering all that we‚Äôve said above about free modules, and how Day convolution is basically the presheaf version of the tensor product from the original category, I would like to repeat some of what <a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~alexc/">Alexander Campbell</a> wrote in response to a <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1650786/day-convolution-intuition">question I asked about Day convolution</a> during the writing of my masters thesis.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful formal analogy between Day convolution and monoid algebra, which takes the following form:</p>

<table class="ba">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>monoid algebra</th>
      <th>Day convolution</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>set</td>
      <td>category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>monoid</td>
      <td>monoidal category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ring <script type="math/tex">R</script></td>
      <td>monoidally cocomplete<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">R</script>-module</td>
      <td>cocomplete <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">R</script>-algebra</td>
      <td>monoidally cocomplete <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>free <script type="math/tex">R</script>-module <script type="math/tex">R^{(X)}</script> on a set <script type="math/tex">X</script></td>
      <td>free cocomplete <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-category <script type="math/tex">\widehat{\mathcal{C}}</script> on a category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>free <script type="math/tex">R</script>-module <script type="math/tex">R^{(X)}</script> on a monoid <script type="math/tex">M</script> with the convolution product</td>
      <td>free monoidally cocomplete <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-category <script type="math/tex">\widehat{\mathcal{A}}</script> on a monoidal category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> with Day convolution</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Profunctors</h2>

<p>Just to have my obligatory ‚Äúhere is something that I don‚Äôt understand‚Äù that all of my posts seem to have, I wrote down in my notes (only a few weeks ago) the following sentence</p>

<pre><code>profunctors! composition is via coends
and this looks like ‚àÉ for composition of relations
</code></pre>

<p>I have a vague idea of what this means: when we compose relations we do it ‚Äòby existence‚Äô, in that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">SR(x,y)\iff\exists t\text{ s.t. }R(x,t)\wedge S(t,y)</script>

<p>and this somehow looks like a coend, but I have no idea (nor, really, the time (nor, really, the skill) to properly think about) how to make this formal. Any ideas?</p>

Today, [`@ququ7`](https://twitter.com/ququ7) tweeted/twote/twut that, [a few years back, Tim Campion had told him how Stokes' theorem is a result about coends](https://twitter.com/ququ7/status/1169048827703287814). All I want to do here is share this great little snippet, but I won't be doing much more than just repeating exactly the contents of the above tweet, so you might as well just go check it out there!

Here's the idea. We look at $$\mathbb{N}$$ as a poset, the category $$\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}$$ of real-vector spaces, and fix some manifold $$X$$. Then we have two pretty standard functors.

Firstly, we have $$C^X:\mathbb{N}^\mathrm{op}\to\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}$$, which sends $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ to the free vector space $$C_n=\langle\varphi\colon Y\to X\rangle_\mathbb{R}$$, where $$\varphi\colon Y\to X$$ are smooth maps from compact, $$n$$-dimensional, oriented manifolds $$Y$$ with boundary, and acts on morphisms by sending $$n\to n+1$$ to the map $$\partial\colon C_{n+1}\to C_n$$, given by taking the boundaries of our manifolds $$Y$$.

Secondly, there is the de Rham functor $$\Omega_X\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}$$, which sends $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ to the space $$\Omega_X^n$$ of smooth $$n$$-forms on $$X$$, and sends $$n\to n+1$$ to the exterior derivative $$\mathrm{d}\colon\Omega_X^n\to\Omega_X^{n+1}$$.

Now we use the usual tensor product on $$\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}$$ to get a functor

$$C^X\otimes\Omega_X\colon\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}^\mathrm{op}\to\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}.$$

We claim that we can make $$C^X\otimes\Omega_X\to\mathbb{R}$$ into a **cowedge**, i.e. that, for all $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$, we can find morphisms $$w_n\colon C_n^X\otimes\Omega_X^n\to\mathbb{R}$$ such that, for any $$f\colon m\to n$$ (and here we can restrict to $$m\to m+1$$, since these are the morphisms in $$\mathbb{N}$$ that generate all the others (that aren't the identity)), the square

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
    C_{m+1}^X\otimes\Omega_X^m & \xrightarrow{\partial\,\otimes\,1} & C_m^X\otimes\Omega_X^m\\
    {\scriptstyle 1\,\otimes\,\mathrm{d}}\bigg\downarrow && \bigg\downarrow{\scriptstyle w_m}\\
    C_{m+1}^X\otimes\Omega_X^{m+1} & \xrightarrow{w_{m+1}} & \mathbb{R}
\end{array}$$

commutes.

The surprising fact, then, is that Stokes' theorem tells us that taking $$w_n$$ to be defined by

$$\int\colon(\varphi\colon Y\to X)\otimes\omega \mapsto \int_Y \varphi^*\omega$$

gives us exactly what we want. Indeed, Stokes' theorem (in some form) says that

$$\int_{\partial Z}\tau=\int_Z \mathrm{d}\tau$$

and, since pullbacks commute with $$\mathrm{d}$$, when we replace $$\tau$$ with $$\varphi^*\omega$$, we get that the above square commutes. Neat!

What is not entirely clear to me, however, is if this is really a fact about _coends_, since then we would need to show that this cowedge is universal. This is something for me to think about the next time I'm bored on the tram.

---

All in all, this is a bit similar to an abstract version of de Rham's theorem, which says that the above integration map (when we replace $$C_n$$ by _singular_ cochains) is a quasi-isomorphism, and the commuting square sort of encodes the fact that integration respects the differentials of the two complexes. (This is what [Daniel Litt](https://twitter.com/littmath) pointed out [in a reply](https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1169081052100530177)).

One other question that I do have is the following: is there something to be gained by writing $$C_X$$ as the functor represented by $$X$$, and using the coend version of the Yoneda lemma? I don't know, but would love to find out!;

<p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/ququ7"><code>@ququ7</code></a> tweeted/twote/twut that, <a href="https://twitter.com/ququ7/status/1169048827703287814">a few years back, Tim Campion had told him how Stokes‚Äô theorem is a result about coends</a>. All I want to do here is share this great little snippet, but I won‚Äôt be doing much more than just repeating exactly the contents of the above tweet, so you might as well just go check it out there!</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the idea. We look at <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}</script> as a poset, the category <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}</script> of real-vector spaces, and fix some manifold <script type="math/tex">X</script>. Then we have two pretty standard functors.</p>

<p>Firstly, we have <script type="math/tex">C^X:\mathbb{N}^\mathrm{op}\to\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}</script>, which sends <script type="math/tex">n\in\mathbb{N}</script> to the free vector space <script type="math/tex">C_n=\langle\varphi\colon Y\to X\rangle_\mathbb{R}</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\varphi\colon Y\to X</script> are smooth maps from compact, <script type="math/tex">n</script>-dimensional, oriented manifolds <script type="math/tex">Y</script> with boundary, and acts on morphisms by sending <script type="math/tex">n\to n+1</script> to the map <script type="math/tex">\partial\colon C_{n+1}\to C_n</script>, given by taking the boundaries of our manifolds <script type="math/tex">Y</script>.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the de Rham functor <script type="math/tex">\Omega_X\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}</script>, which sends <script type="math/tex">n\in\mathbb{N}</script> to the space <script type="math/tex">\Omega_X^n</script> of smooth <script type="math/tex">n</script>-forms on <script type="math/tex">X</script>, and sends <script type="math/tex">n\to n+1</script> to the exterior derivative <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{d}\colon\Omega_X^n\to\Omega_X^{n+1}</script>.</p>

<p>Now we use the usual tensor product on <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}</script> to get a functor</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">C^X\otimes\Omega_X\colon\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}^\mathrm{op}\to\mathsf{Vect}_\mathbb{R}.</script>

<p>We claim that we can make <script type="math/tex">C^X\otimes\Omega_X\to\mathbb{R}</script> into a <strong>cowedge</strong>, i.e. that, for all <script type="math/tex">n\in\mathbb{N}</script>, we can find morphisms <script type="math/tex">w_n\colon C_n^X\otimes\Omega_X^n\to\mathbb{R}</script> such that, for any <script type="math/tex">f\colon m\to n</script> (and here we can restrict to <script type="math/tex">m\to m+1</script>, since these are the morphisms in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}</script> that generate all the others (that aren‚Äôt the identity)), the square</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
    C_{m+1}^X\otimes\Omega_X^m & \xrightarrow{\partial\,\otimes\,1} & C_m^X\otimes\Omega_X^m\\
    {\scriptstyle 1\,\otimes\,\mathrm{d}}\bigg\downarrow && \bigg\downarrow{\scriptstyle w_m}\\
    C_{m+1}^X\otimes\Omega_X^{m+1} & \xrightarrow{w_{m+1}} & \mathbb{R}
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>commutes.</p>

<p>The surprising fact, then, is that Stokes‚Äô theorem tells us that taking <script type="math/tex">w_n</script> to be defined by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int\colon(\varphi\colon Y\to X)\otimes\omega \mapsto \int_Y \varphi^*\omega</script>

<p>gives us exactly what we want. Indeed, Stokes‚Äô theorem (in some form) says that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{\partial Z}\tau=\int_Z \mathrm{d}\tau</script>

<p>and, since pullbacks commute with <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{d}</script>, when we replace <script type="math/tex">\tau</script> with <script type="math/tex">\varphi^*\omega</script>, we get that the above square commutes. Neat!</p>

<p>What is not entirely clear to me, however, is if this is really a fact about <em>coends</em>, since then we would need to show that this cowedge is universal. This is something for me to think about the next time I‚Äôm bored on the tram.</p>

<hr />

<p>All in all, this is a bit similar to an abstract version of de Rham‚Äôs theorem, which says that the above integration map (when we replace <script type="math/tex">C_n</script> by <em>singular</em> cochains) is a quasi-isomorphism, and the commuting square sort of encodes the fact that integration respects the differentials of the two complexes. (This is what <a href="https://twitter.com/littmath">Daniel Litt</a> pointed out <a href="https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1169081052100530177">in a reply</a>).</p>

<p>One other question that I do have is the following: is there something to be gained by writing <script type="math/tex">C_X</script> as the functor represented by <script type="math/tex">X</script>, and using the coend version of the Yoneda lemma? I don‚Äôt know, but would love to find out!</p>

TI"I find myself in a mathematical rut more often than I would like. It is very easy, especially as a PhD student, I think, to become disillusioned with maths, the work that one can do, and academia as a whole. I realised only the other day, after talking to my family, some of the things that can contribute towards this. Hopefully this post can serve as a reminder to myself that I am human being who is trying to be a mathematician, and not the other way around.

These days, living abroad (away from friends and family), most of my social interactions take place with other mathematicians. This is great, because I do love talking about maths, but also has a rather negative effect. Namely, every single person in my office already has a PhD. Because of this, it's very easy to feel like I know absolutely nothing about maths. Combine this with the typical th√©sard problem of "my thesis just has trivial results but even so my proofs are incomplete and bad", reading things written by the geniuses of your field, and throw in a dash of "so much of academia is about trying to sell your maths as having either profitable (for the few) or military applications", and it can be hard to enjoy maths at times.

By no means am I claiming to have a solution to this problem, but I have found a few things that help (some very obvious), so I thought I'd share them here for whatever small help they might be to anybody reading.

1. Talk to people outside of maths as much as you possibly can, especially about things that aren't maths. Family and friends are just so important.
2. Don't give up talking to mathematicians. One thing that prompted me to put down these thoughts on this blog was a [Twitter thread this morning by John Baez](https://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez/status/1161454391901085696) that just got me so excited about maths again. Read things outside of your current work, and try to make time for learning maths that you find irresistibly intriguing, even if it's completely unrelated to the work you have to do.
3. Get involved in some community projects. I've been contributing to a [translation project for Grothendieck's EGA](https://github.com/ryankeleti/ega) recently, and it's been great for me personally: I can use the fact that I speak French and know enough about algebraic geometry to help make something that could hopefully help other people. I've also been working on [LaTex support in riot.im](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3251), so that mathematicians can have an instant-messaging service, like Discord or Slack, where they can actually type how they would write: with nice maths symbols. In general, open-source projects are a great thing to get involved in.
4. Take up bird watching. I know that not everybody might love these feathered friends as much as I do, but I'm far from the first to have written about what a great thing it can be. It's not like you have to do it "seriously" either: I spend a lot of time just giving names to the pigeons I see every day, and watching how they interact with each other. As one of my favourite poets, Wendy Cope, so beautifully writes:

    > _'A great deal of anecdotal evidence suggests that we respond positively to birdsong.'_<br>
    > --- Scientific researcher quoted in _The Daily Telegraph_ 8.2.2012.
    > 
    > Centuries of English verse<br>
    > Suggest the selfsame thing:<br>
    > A negative response is rare<br>
    > When birds are heard to sing.<br>
    >
    > _What's the use of poetry?_<br>
    > You ask. Well, here's a start:<br>
    > It's anecdotal evidence<br>
    > About the human heart.<br>

5. As the above poem also suggests, spend time growing and learning as a human being. It's said so often that it's become clich√©, but being a human being can be very hard. Poetry, music, books, and so on, are all ways that other human beings have tried to convey what they have themselves wanted to hear at one point or another, so listen to what they have to say. But don't get so tied up in listening to artists that you forget to listen to everybody else.

TI"çAs I mentioned in a previous post, I recently saw a talk by [Rachel Hardeman](http://math.ucalgary.ca/math_unitis/profiles/1-7046986) on the A-homotopy theory of graphs, and it really intrigued me. In particular, it seemed to me that there was some nice structure that could be abstractified: that of a "graded homotopy structure", as I've been calling it in my head. Rather than trying to type out everything in [`#math.CT:matrix.org`](https://www.matrix.to/#/#math.CT:matrix.org), I've decided to post it here, in the hope that I might be able to get some answers.

**16/9/19 EDIT:** _As one of my supervisors recently pointed out to me, the property of being an `$$n$$-homotopy' is not transitive, and so this example is really a non-example. I'll keep the post here for reference purposes, but the only useful/true bits are those quoted from \[RH19\]._

---

The main reference is \[RH19\] Rachel Hardeman. _Computing A-homotopy groups using coverings and lifting properties_. [arXiv: 1904.12065](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12065).

### Preliminaries

- Graphs $$G$$ consist of _vertices_ $$V(G)$$ and _edges_ $$E(G)$$, where we write the edge between vertices $$s$$ and $$t$$ as $$[s,t]$$. All graphs are assumed to be _simple_ (no multiple edges between any two points or loops on a single point) and have a _distinguished vertex_ $$x\in V(G)$$. We write $$(G,x)$$ to mean the graph along with its distinguished vertex.
- A _(weak) graph homomorphism_ $$\varphi\colon (G,x)\to(H,y)$$ is a map of sets $$V(G)\to V(H)$$ such that, for all $$[s,t]\in E(G)$$, either $$\varphi(s)=\varphi(t)$$ or $$[\varphi(s),\varphi(t)]\in E(H)$$. It is said to be _based_ if $$\varphi(x)=y$$.
- The _cartesian product_ $$G\mathbin{\square} H$$ of the graphs $$(G,x)$$ and $$(H,y)$$ is the graph with vertex set $$V(G)\times V(H)$$, with distinguished vertex $$(x,y)$$, and with an edge between $$(s,u)$$ and $$(t,v)$$ whenever
    + $$s=t$$ and $$[u,v]\in E(H)$$; or
    + $$u=v$$ and $$[s,t]\in E(G)$$.
- The _path of length $$n$$_, denoted by $$I_n$$, is the graph with vertices labelled from $$0$$ to $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$, and edges $$[i,i+1]$$ for $$i=0,\ldots,n-1$$. The _path of infinite length_, denoted by $$I_\infty$$, has vertices labelled by $$\mathbb{Z}$$.
- We say that two graphs homomorphisms $$\varphi,\psi\colon(G,x)\to(H,y)$$ are _A-homotopic_, written $$\varphi\simeq_A\psi$$, if there exists some $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ and a graph homomorphism $$h\colon G\mathbin{\square} I_n\to H$$ such that
    + $$h(s,0) = \varphi(s)$$ for all $$s\in V(G)$$;
    + $$h(s,n) = \psi(s)$$ for all $$s\in V(G)$$; and
    + $$h(x,i)=y$$ for all $$0\leqslant i\leqslant n$$.
    
    We say that two graphs $$G$$ and $$H$$ are _A-homotopic_ if there exist graph homomorphisms $$\varphi\colon G\to H$$ and $$\psi\colon H\to G$$ such that $$\psi\circ\varphi\simeq_A\operatorname{id}_G$$ and $$\varphi\circ\psi\simeq_A\operatorname{id}_H$$.
- **N.B.** A-homotopy theory is possibly very different from what you might, at a quick first glance, expect. For example, any two cyclic graphs $$C_n$$ and $$C_m$$ (for $$m,n\geqslant 3$$) are A-homotopic if and only if $$m=n$$, and $$C_n$$ is contractible (i.e. homotopic to the graph with a single point and no edges) for $$n=3,4$$, but not for any $$n\geqslant 5$$.
- The _A-homotopic fundamental group_ of a graph can be defined, as well as a simplicial structure on the group of cochains, and all this sort of stuff. This (amongst other nice formalisations that we would hope for) is done in \[RH19\].

### "Graded homotopy" structure

Given two A-homotopic graph homomorphisms $$\varphi\simeq_A\psi$$ we can ask for the _minimal_ such $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ in the definition of the A-homotopy. We then say that the A-homotopy is an _$$n$$-homotopy_, and we extend this definition slightly to allow for the fact that we can trivially consider an $$n$$-homotopy as an $$(n+1)$$-homotopy (in $$n+1$$ various ways, corresponding to the classical idea of simplicial (co)face/(co)degeneracy (depending on your choice of nomenclature) maps). That is, we say $$n$$-homotopic to mean "$$m$$-homotopic with $$m\leqslant n$$".

We say that two graphs $$G,H$$ are _$$n$$-homotopic_ if there exist graph homomorphisms $$\varphi\colon G\to H$$ and $$\psi\colon H\to G$$ such that $$\psi\circ\varphi$$ is $$m_1$$-homotopic to $$\operatorname{id}_G$$ and $$\varphi\circ\psi$$ is $$m_2$$-homotopic to $$\operatorname{id}_H$$, with $$\operatorname{max}\{m_1,m_2\}=n$$.

Then we can consider the category $$\mathsf{Grph}_n$$, which has objects being equivalence classes of $$n$$-homotopic graphs, and morphisms being equivalence classes of $$n$$-homotopic graph homomorphisms. This gives us the following structure:

- $$\mathsf{Grph}_0 = \mathsf{Grph}$$;
- $$\mathsf{Grph}_\infty = \mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{Grph})$$;
- functors $$\mathsf{Grph}_n \to \mathsf{Grph}_{n+1}$$ that are surjective on objects, where functoriality relies on the fact that $$n$$-homotopies can be considered as $$(n+1)$$-homotopies.

We can think of the number $$n$$ as some sort of "complexity" of the homotopy: small $$n$$ correspond to "homotopies that can be performed in a few steps" (here it is a good idea to see some of the examples in \[RH19\] to get an idea of how graph homotopies behave).

### Questions

If anybody has any answers to, or comments about, the following questions (or this post in general) then please don't hesitate to get in touch!

1. What is this structure? Some sort of enrichment? Does it already have a name?
2. What other examples exist? For example, it would be nice to get something similar for the category of chain complexes of an abelian category, but I see no way a priori of assigning "complexity" to a homotopy for an arbitrary choice of abelian category. If things are enriched over metric spaces, however, then this is a different story...
3. It seems believable that we could define something analogous with $$\mathbb{R}^{\geqslant0}$$ instead of $$\mathbb{N}$$. Could we do so for arbitrary (bounded-below) posets?
4. Does this tie in to the idea of "approximate composition" (c.f. [Walter Tholen's talk on metagories at ACT2019](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ACT2019/preproceedings/Walter%20Tholen%20Approximate%20composition%20(revised).pdf)).

  <li>It seems believable that we could define something analogous with <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^{\geqslant0}</script> instead of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}</script>. Could we do so for arbitrary (bounded-below) posets?</li>

## Background and strictification

Before I get to the point of this post (which is to help me to remember the differences between 2-categories, bicategories, and double categories[^1]), I'll just say a tiny bit about why I'm an idiot.

In some sense I had just assumed that 2-categories were kind of uninteresting, for two reasons: firstly, "they're just $$n$$-categories with $$n$$=2"; and secondly, every weak 2-category can be strictified, so we can just always take strict models and everything works out just nicely.
Both of these things are rather bad points of view to take.

For the latter point, it's important to note that, yes, weak 2-categories can be strictified, and every pseudofunctor is equivalent to a strict one, but it is **not** true that every pseudonatural transformation is equivalent to a (strict) natural transformation.

As explained in [Mike Shulman's talk](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/slides/shulman.pdf), working in the $$(2,1)$$-topos $$[\mathbb{D}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Gpd}]$$, every pseudofunctor $$X\colon\mathbb{D}^{\text{op}}\to\mathsf{Gpd}$$ is equivalent to a strict one, but **not** every pseudonatural transformation $$X\rightsquigarrow Y$$ is equivalent to a strict one.
But we do have the following lemma (from Mike's talk).

**Lemma.** For any $$Y\in[\mathbb{D}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Gpd}]$$ there is a strict $$\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y$$ and a bijection between pseudonatural $$X\rightsquigarrow Y$$ and strict $$X\to\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y$$.

**Proof**. Almost by definition: a pseudonatural $$X\rightsquigarrow Y$$ assigns to each $$x\in X(d)$$ some image $$f_x(x)\in Y(d)$$ along with an isomorphism $$\gamma^*(f_x(x))\cong f_{x'}(\gamma^*(x))$$ for all $$\gamma\colon x\to x'$$ in $$\mathbb{D}$$, and this isomorphism satisfies a coherence condition.
So we just define $$\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y(d)$$ to consist of all this data.

There is then a lovely theory of _coflexible_ objects, which are those $$Y$$ such that the canonical morphism $$Y\to\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y$$ has a strict retraction.
These objects are such that **all** pseudonatural transformations _into_ them are isomorphic to _strict_ such ones.[^2]

## The idea

### Roughly

- A 2-category should be something which has _objects_, _1-morphisms_ between the objects, and _2-morphisms_ between the morphisms.
- We should be able to compose 1-morphisms 'along objects', in that, given 1-morphisms $$f\colon x\to y$$ and $$g\colon y\to z$$, we should get some 1-morphism $$g\circ f\colon x\to z$$.
- We should be able to compose 2-morphisms 'along objects' (so-called _horizontally_)

![horizontal composition](/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-horizontal-2-composition.png){:.centred}

but _also_ 'along 1-morphisms' (so-called _vertically_)

![vertical composition](/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-vertical-2-composition.png){:.centred}

and we ask that both senses of composition be associative _only up to coherent associator 2-morphisms_.

### Categorification and monoidal delooping

An $$(n=2)$$-category can be thought of as the Oidification (or [horizontal categorification](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/horizontal+categorification)) of a monoidal category: it is like a monoidal category with many objects.
To see this, note that the delooping of a monoidal category (i.e. the category where we shift all objects/morphisms 'up one degree') is exactly a one object $$(n=2)$$-category, with 1-morphisms corresponding to the objects of the monoidal category, and 2-morphisms corresponding to the morphisms of the monoidal category.

## Strict vs. weak

### The categories

The general consensus is to call _strict_ 2-categories "**2-categories**", and the algebraic notion of _weak_ 2-categories "**bicategories**".
This can be confusing, [for a few reasons](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bicategory#terminology), but such is life.
From now on, in this post, we will say **$$(n=2)$$-categories** to talk about both senses of 2-categories.

Specifically, a _2-category_ is a category enriched over the cartesian monoidal category $$\mathsf{Cat}$$; a _bicategory_ is a category **weakly** enriched over $$\mathsf{Cat}$$ (so the hom-objects are categories but the associativity and unit laws only hold up to coherent isomorphism).

### The functors

Whether we take strict or weak $$(n=2)$$-categories, we can still choose whether we want our $$(n=2)$$-functors to be strict or weak.

A _2-functor_ is a strict $$(n=2)$$-functor (which [usually](https://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-functor#fn:1) only makes sense between 2-categories); a _pseudofunctor_ is a weak $$(n=2)$$-functor (so the composition of 1-morphisms is preserved only up to coherent (specified) 2-isomorphisms, and similarly for the identity 1-morphisms) (which can be between strict or weak $$(n=2)$$-categories).

If we forget the 2-structure of an $$(n=2)$$-category and consider the hom-categories as discrete, then both of these notions of $$(n=2)$$-functors reduce to 1-functors between 1-categories.
There is, however, an even weaker type of $$(n=2)$$-functor for which this is **not** the case: a(n) _(op)lax 2-functor_: here the associator and compositor 2-cells are **not** required to even be coherent _isomorphisms_, but instead just coherent _morphisms_, in some direction (with one direction corresponding to lax and the other to oplax).
This is exactly the idea of an (op)lax functor of monoidal categories, and so reassures us that $$(n=2)$$-categories can be thought of as monoidal categories with multiple objects, as mentioned above.

That is,

| $$(n=2)$$-functor | compositor |
| ----------------- | ---- |
| 2-functor | $$F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f)$$ |
| pseudofunctor | $$F(g\circ f)\cong F(g)\circ F(f)$$ |
| (op)lax 2-functor| $$F(g\circ f)\Rightarrow F(g)\circ F(f)$$ |
{:.bordered-table}

At a first glance, (op)-lax functors seem like almost too weak to be useful, but there are [many nice examples](https://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lax+functor#examples) of when they are good things to study.

## Double categories

Something that looks a bit like an $$(n=2)$$-category when you unwrap the abstract definition is a _double category_: an internal category $$\mathscr{C}=(\mathcal{C}_1\rightrightarrows\mathcal{C}_0)$$ of $$\mathsf{Cat}$$.
This means that it has

- _objects_, given by the objects of $$\mathcal{C}_0$$;
- _vertical morphisms_, given by the morphisms of $$\mathcal{C}_0$$;
- _horizontal morphisms_, given by the objects of $$\mathcal{C}_1$$; and
- _2-cells_, or _squares_, given by the morphisms of $$\mathcal{C}_1$$.

We can picture the 2-cells as a square (hence the name), as

![squares](/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-double-square.png){:.centred}

where $$x_0,x_1,y_0,y_1\in\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}_0$$ are objects, $$f,g\in\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}_1$$ are horizontal morphisms, $$\alpha\beta\in\operatorname{Arr}\mathcal{C}_0$$ are vertical morphisms, and $$\phi\in\operatorname{Arr}\mathcal{C}_1$$ is the 2-cell.

Composition 'horizontally' of two squares, left and right of each other, is given by the usual composition in the categories $$\mathcal{C}_0$$ and $$\mathcal{C}_1$$; composition 'vertically' of two squares, one above the other, is given by the composition operation on $$\mathcal{C}_1\rightrightarrows\mathcal{C}_0$$, coming from the fact that $$\mathscr{C}$$ is an internal category.

There are two _edge categories_ associated to $$\mathscr{C}$$, given by taking the objects and either the vertical or the horizontal morphisms as morphisms.
If the two edge categories agree then we say that $$\mathscr{C}$$ is _edge-symmetric_.

### Examples

From [the nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+category#examples), we have some fun examples.

|  | objects | vertical | horizontal | 2-cells |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| $$\mathsf{Prof}$$ | small categories | functors | profunctors | nat. trans. |
| $$\mathsf{Mod}$$ | model categories | left Quil. functors | right Quil. functors | nat. trans. |
| $$\mathsf{MonCat}$$ | monoidal categories | colax mon. functors | lax mon. functors | mon. nat. trans. |
| $$\mathsf{Dbl}\Pi(X)$$ | points of top. space $$X$$ | paths | paths | homotopies |
{:.bordered-table}

For more details about why $$\mathsf{Mod}$$ is so interesting, see \[S11\].

Note that we can also get weak versions of double categories, in many ways, as described [here](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+category#weakenings).

## 1-categories as 2-categories as double categories

- We can consider any 1-category as an $$(n=2)$$-category by taking the 2-cells to just be identities.
- We can consider any $$(n=2)$$-category as an edge-symmetric double category, its _double category of squares_, via the so-called _quintet construction_: by taking both vertical and horizontal morphisms to be the 1-morphisms, and the 2-cells to be the 2-morphisms.
    We could also construct two other double categories: by taking either the vertical or the horizontal morphisms to be the 1-morphisms, and the other to be just the identity 1-morphisms.
    Finally, one last construction is the _mate construction_: the vertical arrows are adjunctions, the horizontal arrows are 1-morphisms, and the 2-cells are [mate-pairs of 2-morphisms](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mate).
- In the opposite direction to the above, there are two underlying 2-categories of any double category, where we let 1-morphisms be just the vertical (resp. horizontal) morphisms, and the 2-morphisms are for commutative squares whose horizontal (resp. vertical) arrows are identities.
    We call these the _associated vertical_ (resp. _horizontal_) _2-category_.

Almost by definition: a pseudonatural <script type="math/tex">X\rightsquigarrow Y</script> assigns to each <script type="math/tex">x\in X(d)</script> some image <script type="math/tex">f_x(x)\in Y(d)</script> along with an isomorphism <script type="math/tex">\gamma^*(f_x(x))\cong f_{x'}(\gamma^*(x))</script> for all <script type="math/tex">\gamma\colon x\to x'</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{D}</script>, and this isomorphism satisfies a coherence condition.
So we just define <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y(d)</script> to consist of all this data.</p>

<p>There is then a lovely theory of <em>coflexible</em> objects, which are those <script type="math/tex">Y</script> such that the canonical morphism <script type="math/tex">Y\to\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y</script> has a strict retraction.
These objects are such that <strong>all</strong> pseudonatural transformations <em>into</em> them are isomorphic to <em>strict</em> such ones.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2>The idea</h2>

<h3>Roughly</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A 2-category should be something which has <em>objects</em>, <em>1-morphisms</em> between the objects, and <em>2-morphisms</em> between the morphisms.</li>
  <li>We should be able to compose 1-morphisms ‚Äòalong objects‚Äô, in that, given 1-morphisms <script type="math/tex">f\colon x\to y</script> and <script type="math/tex">g\colon y\to z</script>, we should get some 1-morphism <script type="math/tex">g\circ f\colon x\to z</script>.</li>
  <li>We should be able to compose 2-morphisms ‚Äòalong objects‚Äô (so-called <em>horizontally</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-horizontal-2-composition.png" alt="horizontal composition" class="centred" /></p>

<p>but <em>also</em> ‚Äòalong 1-morphisms‚Äô (so-called <em>vertically</em>)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-vertical-2-composition.png" alt="vertical composition" class="centred" /></p>

<p>and we ask that both senses of composition be associative <em>only up to coherent associator 2-morphisms</em>.</p>

<h3>Categorification and monoidal delooping</h3>

<p>An <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category can be thought of as the Oidification (or <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/horizontal+categorification">horizontal categorification</a>) of a monoidal category: it is like a monoidal category with many objects.
To see this, note that the delooping of a monoidal category (i.e. the category where we shift all objects/morphisms ‚Äòup one degree‚Äô) is exactly a one object <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category, with 1-morphisms corresponding to the objects of the monoidal category, and 2-morphisms corresponding to the morphisms of the monoidal category.</p>

<h2>Strict vs. weak</h2>

<h3>The categories</h3>

<p>The general consensus is to call <em>strict</em> 2-categories ‚Äú<strong>2-categories</strong>‚Äù, and the algebraic notion of <em>weak</em> 2-categories ‚Äú<strong>bicategories</strong>‚Äù.
This can be confusing, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bicategory#terminology">for a few reasons</a>, but such is life.
From now on, in this post, we will say <strong><script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-categories</strong> to talk about both senses of 2-categories.</p>

<p>Specifically, a <em>2-category</em> is a category enriched over the cartesian monoidal category <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Cat}</script>; a <em>bicategory</em> is a category <strong>weakly</strong> enriched over <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Cat}</script> (so the hom-objects are categories but the associativity and unit laws only hold up to coherent isomorphism).</p>

<h3>The functors</h3>

<p>Whether we take strict or weak <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-categories, we can still choose whether we want our <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-functors to be strict or weak.</p>

<p>A <em>2-functor</em> is a strict <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-functor (which <a href="https://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-functor#fn:1">usually</a> only makes sense between 2-categories); a <em>pseudofunctor</em> is a weak <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-functor (so the composition of 1-morphisms is preserved only up to coherent (specified) 2-isomorphisms, and similarly for the identity 1-morphisms) (which can be between strict or weak <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-categories).</p>

<p>If we forget the 2-structure of an <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category and consider the hom-categories as discrete, then both of these notions of <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-functors reduce to 1-functors between 1-categories.
There is, however, an even weaker type of <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-functor for which this is <strong>not</strong> the case: a(n) <em>(op)lax 2-functor</em>: here the associator and compositor 2-cells are <strong>not</strong> required to even be coherent <em>isomorphisms</em>, but instead just coherent <em>morphisms</em>, in some direction (with one direction corresponding to lax and the other to oplax).
This is exactly the idea of an (op)lax functor of monoidal categories, and so reassures us that <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-categories can be thought of as monoidal categories with multiple objects, as mentioned above.</p>

<p>That is,</p>

<table class="bordered-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <td><script type="math/tex">F(g\circ f)\Rightarrow F(g)\circ F(f)</script></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>At a first glance, (op)-lax functors seem like almost too weak to be useful, but there are <a href="https://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lax+functor#examples">many nice examples</a> of when they are good things to study.</p>

<h2>Double categories</h2>

<p>Something that looks a bit like an <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category when you unwrap the abstract definition is a <em>double category</em>: an internal category <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{C}=(\mathcal{C}_1\rightrightarrows\mathcal{C}_0)</script> of <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Cat}</script>.
This means that it has</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>objects</em>, given by the objects of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}_0</script>;</li>
  <li><em>vertical morphisms</em>, given by the morphisms of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}_0</script>;</li>
  <li><em>horizontal morphisms</em>, given by the objects of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}_1</script>; and</li>
  <li><em>2-cells</em>, or <em>squares</em>, given by the morphisms of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}_1</script>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can picture the 2-cells as a square (hence the name), as</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-double-square.png" alt="squares" class="centred" /></p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">x_0,x_1,y_0,y_1\in\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}_0</script> are objects, <script type="math/tex">f,g\in\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}_1</script> are horizontal morphisms, <script type="math/tex">\alpha\beta\in\operatorname{Arr}\mathcal{C}_0</script> are vertical morphisms, and <script type="math/tex">\phi\in\operatorname{Arr}\mathcal{C}_1</script> is the 2-cell.</p>

<p>Composition ‚Äòhorizontally‚Äô of two squares, left and right of each other, is given by the usual composition in the categories <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}_0</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}_1</script>; composition ‚Äòvertically‚Äô of two squares, one above the other, is given by the composition operation on <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}_1\rightrightarrows\mathcal{C}_0</script>, coming from the fact that <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{C}</script> is an internal category.</p>

<p>There are two <em>edge categories</em> associated to <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{C}</script>, given by taking the objects and either the vertical or the horizontal morphisms as morphisms.
If the two edge categories agree then we say that <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{C}</script> is <em>edge-symmetric</em>.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>From <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+category#examples">the nLab</a>, we have some fun examples.</p>

<p>Note that we can also get weak versions of double categories, in many ways, as described <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+category#weakenings">here</a>.</p>

<h2>1-categories as 2-categories as double categories</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We can consider any 1-category as an <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category by taking the 2-cells to just be identities.</li>
  <li>We can consider any <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category as an edge-symmetric double category, its <em>double category of squares</em>, via the so-called <em>quintet construction</em>: by taking both vertical and horizontal morphisms to be the 1-morphisms, and the 2-cells to be the 2-morphisms.
  We could also construct two other double categories: by taking either the vertical or the horizontal morphisms to be the 1-morphisms, and the other to be just the identity 1-morphisms.
  Finally, one last construction is the <em>mate construction</em>: the vertical arrows are adjunctions, the horizontal arrows are 1-morphisms, and the 2-cells are <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mate">mate-pairs of 2-morphisms</a>.</li>
  <li>In the opposite direction to the above, there are two underlying 2-categories of any double category, where we let 1-morphisms be just the vertical (resp. horizontal) morphisms, and the 2-morphisms are for commutative squares whose horizontal (resp. vertical) arrows are identities.
  We call these the <em>associated vertical</em> (resp. <em>horizontal</em>) <em>2-category</em>.</li>

        <p>What with all the wild applications of, and progress in, the theory of <script type="math/tex">\infty</script>-categories, I had really neglected studying any kind of lower higher-category theory.
But, as in many other ways, CT2019 opened my eyes somewhat, and now I‚Äôm trying to catch up on the theory of 2-categories, which have some really beautiful structure and examples.</p>

<h2>Background and strictification</h2>

<p>Before I get to the point of this post (which is to help me to remember the differences between 2-categories, bicategories, and double categories<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>), I‚Äôll just say a tiny bit about why I‚Äôm an idiot.</p>

<p>In some sense I had just assumed that 2-categories were kind of uninteresting, for two reasons: firstly, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just <script type="math/tex">n</script>-categories with <script type="math/tex">n</script>=2‚Äù; and secondly, every weak 2-category can be strictified, so we can just always take strict models and everything works out just nicely.
Both of these things are rather bad points of view to take.</p>

<p>For the latter point, it‚Äôs important to note that, yes, weak 2-categories can be strictified, and every pseudofunctor is equivalent to a strict one, but it is <strong>not</strong> true that every pseudonatural transformation is equivalent to a (strict) natural transformation.</p>

<p>As explained in <a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/slides/shulman.pdf">Mike Shulman‚Äôs talk</a>, working in the <script type="math/tex">(2,1)</script>-topos <script type="math/tex">[\mathbb{D}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Gpd}]</script>, every pseudofunctor <script type="math/tex">X\colon\mathbb{D}^{\text{op}}\to\mathsf{Gpd}</script> is equivalent to a strict one, but <strong>not</strong> every pseudonatural transformation <script type="math/tex">X\rightsquigarrow Y</script> is equivalent to a strict one.
But we do have the following lemma (from Mike‚Äôs talk).</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> For any <script type="math/tex">Y\in[\mathbb{D}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Gpd}]</script> there is a strict <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y</script> and a bijection between pseudonatural <script type="math/tex">X\rightsquigarrow Y</script> and strict <script type="math/tex">X\to\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Almost by definition: a pseudonatural <script type="math/tex">X\rightsquigarrow Y</script> assigns to each <script type="math/tex">x\in X(d)</script> some image <script type="math/tex">f_x(x)\in Y(d)</script> along with an isomorphism <script type="math/tex">\gamma^*(f_x(x))\cong f_{x'}(\gamma^*(x))</script> for all <script type="math/tex">\gamma\colon x\to x'</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{D}</script>, and this isomorphism satisfies a coherence condition.
So we just define <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y(d)</script> to consist of all this data.</p>

<p>There is then a lovely theory of <em>coflexible</em> objects, which are those <script type="math/tex">Y</script> such that the canonical morphism <script type="math/tex">Y\to\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{D}}Y</script> has a strict retraction.
These objects are such that <strong>all</strong> pseudonatural transformations <em>into</em> them are isomorphic to <em>strict</em> such ones.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2>The idea</h2>

<h3>Roughly</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A 2-category should be something which has <em>objects</em>, <em>1-morphisms</em> between the objects, and <em>2-morphisms</em> between the morphisms.</li>

  <li>We should be able to compose 2-morphisms ‚Äòalong objects‚Äô (so-called <em>horizontally</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-horizontal-2-composition.png" alt="horizontal composition" class="centred" /></p>

<p>but <em>also</em> ‚Äòalong 1-morphisms‚Äô (so-called <em>vertically</em>)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2019-07-15-vertical-2-composition.png" alt="vertical composition" class="centred" /></p>

<p>and we ask that both senses of composition be associative <em>only up to coherent associator 2-morphisms</em>.</p>

<h3>Categorification and monoidal delooping</h3>

<p>Note that we can also get weak versions of double categories, in many ways, as described <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+category#weakenings">here</a>.</p>

<h2>1-categories as 2-categories as double categories</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We can consider any 1-category as an <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category by taking the 2-cells to just be identities.</li>
  <li>We can consider any <script type="math/tex">(n=2)</script>-category as an edge-symmetric double category, its <em>double category of squares</em>, via the so-called <em>quintet construction</em>: by taking both vertical and horizontal morphisms to be the 1-morphisms, and the 2-cells to be the 2-morphisms.
  We could also construct two other double categories: by taking either the vertical or the horizontal morphisms to be the 1-morphisms, and the other to be just the identity 1-morphisms.
  Finally, one last construction is the <em>mate construction</em>: the vertical arrows are adjunctions, the horizontal arrows are 1-morphisms, and the 2-cells are <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mate">mate-pairs of 2-morphisms</a>.</li>
  <li>In the opposite direction to the above, there are two underlying 2-categories of any double category, where we let 1-morphisms be just the vertical (resp. horizontal) morphisms, and the 2-morphisms are for commutative squares whose horizontal (resp. vertical) arrows are identities.
  We call these the <em>associated vertical</em> (resp. <em>horizontal</em>) <em>2-category</em>.</li>

## Bimodules

A good place to begin is with the definition of a _bimodule_.

### Classically

Given rings $$R$$ and $$S$$, we say that an abelian group $$M$$ is an _$$(R,S)$$-bimodule_ if it is a left $$R$$-module and a right $$S$$-module **in a compatible way**: we ask that $$(rm)s=r(ms)$$.

Thinking about this definition a bit (or maybe recalling an algebra class), we see that this is equivalent to asking that $$M$$ be a right module over $$R^{\text{op}}\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}S$$ (or, equivalently, a left module over $$R\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}S^{\text{op}}$$), where $$R^{\text{op}}$$ is the _opposite_ ring of $$R$$, given by just 'turning the multiplication around'.[^1]

### Categorically

Modulo a bunch of technical conditions on the categories involved,[^2] a _bimodule_ is a $$\mathcal{V}$$-functor (i.e. a functor of $$\mathcal{V}$$-enriched categories) $$\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}\otimes\mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{V}$$.

We can recover the previous definition similar to how we can recover the definition of an $$R$$-module as an $$\mathsf{Ab}$$-enriched functor $$R^{\text{op}}\to\mathsf{Ab}$$. Or, taking $$\mathcal{V}=\mathsf{Vect}$$, and $$\mathcal{C}=\mathbb{B}A$$, $$\mathcal{D}=\mathbb{B}B$$, with $$A$$ and $$B$$ both vector spaces, we recover the notion of a vector space with a left $$A$$-action and a right $$B$$-action.

A fundamental example that seems a bit different from this algebraic one, however, arises when we take $$\mathcal{V}=\mathsf{Set}$$ and $$\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{D}$$ to be arbitrary (small) categories.
Then the hom functor $$\mathcal{C}(-,-)\colon\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Set}$$ is a bimodule.
This suggests that we should maybe somehow think of bimodules as generalised hom functors, where the objects can live in a different category.

As a small aside, there is some hot debate about whether to use $$\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}\otimes\mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{V}$$ or $$\mathcal{C}\otimes\mathcal{D}^{\text{op}}\to\mathcal{V}$$, and although the first seems more natural (in that it corresponds to the way we write hom functors), the second is slightly nicer in that functors $$\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$$ give you profunctors by composition with the **covariant** Yoneda embedding, as opposed to the contravariant one.
But the two are formally dual, so it's really not the biggest of issues.

## Profunctors, distributors, bimodules, or whatever

Of course, lots of people have different preferences for names, but a _profunctor_ is (using the convention of Borceux and Dejean) a functor $$\mathcal{D}^{\text{op}}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Set}$$.
People often write such a thing as $$\mathcal{C}\nrightarrow\mathcal{D}$$.
We can define their compositions via colimits or coends:

$$Q\circ P=\int^{d\in\mathcal{D}}P(d,-)\otimes Q(-,d)$$

(although we don't really care so much about this post).

**Update: we talk about this a bit more in [Part 3 of the series on Day convolution](/blog/2019/09/05/day-convolution-part-3.html)**

### Yoneda

Every functor $$F\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$$ gives a profunctor $$F^*\colon\mathcal{C}\nrightarrow\mathcal{D}$$ by setting

$$F^*(d,c) = \mathcal{D}(d,Fc),$$

and $$F^*$$ has a right adjoint $$F_*\colon\mathcal{D}\nrightarrow\mathcal{C}$$ given by

$$F_*(c,d) = \mathcal{D}(Fc,d),$$

where we define adjunctions of profunctors using the classical notion of natural transformations.

If we write $$\mathbb{1}$$ to mean the category with one object and one (identity) (endo)morphism then any (small) category $$\mathcal{C}$$ can be identified with the functor category $$\mathsf{Fun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})$$, and the presheaf category $$\hat{\mathcal{C}}:=\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Set})$$ is just the category $$\mathsf{Profun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})$$.
Then the Yoneda embedding is the inclusion

$$\mathsf{Fun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})\to\mathsf{Profun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})$$

given by $$F\mapsto F^*$$.

### Recovering functors

**Theorem.** A profunctor $$\mathbb{1}\nrightarrow\mathcal{C}$$ is a functor (via Yoneda[^4]) if and only if it admits a right adjoint.
More generally, a profunctor $$\mathcal{A}\nrightarrow\mathcal{C}$$, for any small category $$\mathcal{A}$$, is a functor (via Yoneda) if and only if it admits a right adjoint.

**Proof.** \[Theorem 2, BD86\].

We will come back to this fact later.

## Cauchy completion

The _Cauchy completion_ of a (small) category $$\mathcal{C}$$ can be defined in many ways (as described in \[BD86\]), but we pick the following: the Cauchy completion of $$\mathcal{C}$$ is the full subcategory $$\overline{\mathcal{C}}$$ of $$\hat{\mathcal{C}}:=\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Set})$$ spanned by _absolutely presentable_[^3] presheaves.

The idea of Cauchy completeness for a category is in some sense meant to mirror that of Cauchy completeness of real numbers: if we think of a metric space as a category enriched over (the poset of) non-negative real numbers, then we recover this analytic notion (see \[Example 3, BD86\]).

**Lemma.** A presheaf $$\mathcal{F}\in\hat{\mathcal{C}}$$ is absolutely presentable if and only if it admits a right adjoint.

**Proof.** \[Propositions 2 and 4, BD86\].

## Internal categories

Recall that \[Theorem 2, BD86\] tells us that the profunctors that are functors (via Yoneda) are exactly those that admit right adjoints (which, by \[Propositions 2 and 4, BD86\], are exactly those (in the case where $$\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{1}$$) that are in the Cauchy completion of $$\mathcal{C}$$).

Now for what motivated me to write this post: something I saw in [Bryce Clarke](https://twitter.com/8ryceClarke)'s talk [Internal lenses as monad morphisms](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/slides/63.pdf) at CT2019.[^5]

Given some category $$\mathcal{E}$$ with pullbacks, we can define an _internal category of $$\mathcal{E}$$_ as a monad in the 2-category $$\mathsf{Span}(\mathcal{E})$$, but it is **not** the case that internal functors are just (colax) morphisms of monads: **we need to require that the 1-cell admits a right adjoint** (which reduces to asking that the left leg of the corresponding span is an identity/isomorphism).

This is now not so much of a surprising condition, since we've already seen that this left-adjoint condition is what ensures that profunctors are actually functors!

What happens then, we may well ask, if we don't ask for this condition?
We recover the idea of a **Mealy morphism**.[^6]

        <p>An idea that came up in a few talks at CT2019 was that of ‚Äòspans whose left leg is a left adjoint‚Äô.
I managed (luckily) to get a chance to ask Mike Shulman a few questions about this, as well as post in <a href="https://www.matrix.to/#/#math.CT:matrix.org"><code>#math.CT:matrix.org</code></a>.
What follows are some things that I learnt (mostly from [BD86]).</p>

<h2>Bimodules</h2>

<p>A good place to begin is with the definition of a <em>bimodule</em>.</p>

<h3>Classically</h3>

<p>Given rings <script type="math/tex">R</script> and <script type="math/tex">S</script>, we say that an abelian group <script type="math/tex">M</script> is an <em><script type="math/tex">(R,S)</script>-bimodule</em> if it is a left <script type="math/tex">R</script>-module and a right <script type="math/tex">S</script>-module <strong>in a compatible way</strong>: we ask that <script type="math/tex">(rm)s=r(ms)</script>.</p>

<p>Thinking about this definition a bit (or maybe recalling an algebra class), we see that this is equivalent to asking that <script type="math/tex">M</script> be a right module over <script type="math/tex">R^{\text{op}}\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}S</script> (or, equivalently, a left module over <script type="math/tex">R\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}S^{\text{op}}</script>), where <script type="math/tex">R^{\text{op}}</script> is the <em>opposite</em> ring of <script type="math/tex">R</script>, given by just ‚Äòturning the multiplication around‚Äô.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3>Categorically</h3>

<p>Modulo a bunch of technical conditions on the categories involved,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> a <em>bimodule</em> is a <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-functor (i.e. a functor of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-enriched categories) <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}\otimes\mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{V}</script>.</p>

<p>We can recover the previous definition similar to how we can recover the definition of an <script type="math/tex">R</script>-module as an <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Ab}</script>-enriched functor <script type="math/tex">R^{\text{op}}\to\mathsf{Ab}</script>. Or, taking <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}=\mathsf{Vect}</script>, and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}=\mathbb{B}A</script>, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{D}=\mathbb{B}B</script>, with <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> both vector spaces, we recover the notion of a vector space with a left <script type="math/tex">A</script>-action and a right <script type="math/tex">B</script>-action.</p>

<p>A fundamental example that seems a bit different from this algebraic one, however, arises when we take <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}=\mathsf{Set}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{D}</script> to be arbitrary (small) categories.
Then the hom functor <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}(-,-)\colon\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Set}</script> is a bimodule.
This suggests that we should maybe somehow think of bimodules as generalised hom functors, where the objects can live in a different category.</p>

<p>As a small aside, there is some hot debate about whether to use <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}\otimes\mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{V}</script> or <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}\otimes\mathcal{D}^{\text{op}}\to\mathcal{V}</script>, and although the first seems more natural (in that it corresponds to the way we write hom functors), the second is slightly nicer in that functors <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</script> give you profunctors by composition with the <strong>covariant</strong> Yoneda embedding, as opposed to the contravariant one.
But the two are formally dual, so it‚Äôs really not the biggest of issues.</p>

<h2>Profunctors, distributors, bimodules, or whatever</h2>

<p>Of course, lots of people have different preferences for names, but a <em>profunctor</em> is (using the convention of Borceux and Dejean) a functor <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{D}^{\text{op}}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Set}</script>.
People often write such a thing as <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}\nrightarrow\mathcal{D}</script>.
We can define their compositions via colimits or coends:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Q\circ P=\int^{d\in\mathcal{D}}P(d,-)\otimes Q(-,d)</script>

<p>(although we don‚Äôt really care so much about this post).</p>

<p><strong>Update: we talk about this a bit more in <a href="/blog/2019/09/05/day-convolution-part-3.html">Part 3 of the series on Day convolution</a></strong></p>

<h3>Yoneda</h3>

<p>Every functor <script type="math/tex">F\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</script> gives a profunctor <script type="math/tex">F^*\colon\mathcal{C}\nrightarrow\mathcal{D}</script> by setting</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F^*(d,c) = \mathcal{D}(d,Fc),</script>

<p>and <script type="math/tex">F^*</script> has a right adjoint <script type="math/tex">F_*\colon\mathcal{D}\nrightarrow\mathcal{C}</script> given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F_*(c,d) = \mathcal{D}(Fc,d),</script>

<p>where we define adjunctions of profunctors using the classical notion of natural transformations.</p>

<p>If we write <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{1}</script> to mean the category with one object and one (identity) (endo)morphism then any (small) category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> can be identified with the functor category <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Fun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})</script>, and the presheaf category <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathcal{C}}:=\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Set})</script> is just the category <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Profun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})</script>.
Then the Yoneda embedding is the inclusion</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Fun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})\to\mathsf{Profun}(\mathbb{1},\mathcal{C})</script>

<p>given by <script type="math/tex">F\mapsto F^*</script>.</p>

<h3>Recovering functors</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> A profunctor <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{1}\nrightarrow\mathcal{C}</script> is a functor (via Yoneda<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup>) if and only if it admits a right adjoint.
More generally, a profunctor <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}\nrightarrow\mathcal{C}</script>, for any small category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script>, is a functor (via Yoneda) if and only if it admits a right adjoint.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> [Theorem 2, BD86].</p>

<p>We will come back to this fact later.</p>

<h2>Cauchy completion</h2>

<p>The <em>Cauchy completion</em> of a (small) category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> can be defined in many ways (as described in [BD86]), but we pick the following: the Cauchy completion of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> is the full subcategory <script type="math/tex">\overline{\mathcal{C}}</script> of <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathcal{C}}:=\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}},\mathsf{Set})</script> spanned by <em>absolutely presentable</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup> presheaves.</p>

<p>The idea of Cauchy completeness for a category is in some sense meant to mirror that of Cauchy completeness of real numbers: if we think of a metric space as a category enriched over (the poset of) non-negative real numbers, then we recover this analytic notion (see [Example 3, BD86]).</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> A presheaf <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{F}\in\hat{\mathcal{C}}</script> is absolutely presentable if and only if it admits a right adjoint.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> [Propositions 2 and 4, BD86].</p>

<h2>Internal categories</h2>

<p>Recall that [Theorem 2, BD86] tells us that the profunctors that are functors (via Yoneda) are exactly those that admit right adjoints (which, by [Propositions 2 and 4, BD86], are exactly those (in the case where <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{1}</script>) that are in the Cauchy completion of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>).</p>

<p>Now for what motivated me to write this post: something I saw in <a href="https://twitter.com/8ryceClarke">Bryce Clarke</a>‚Äôs talk <a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/slides/63.pdf">Internal lenses as monad morphisms</a> at CT2019.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Given some category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script> with pullbacks, we can define an <em>internal category of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script></em> as a monad in the 2-category <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Span}(\mathcal{E})</script>, but it is <strong>not</strong> the case that internal functors are just (colax) morphisms of monads: <strong>we need to require that the 1-cell admits a right adjoint</strong> (which reduces to asking that the left leg of the corresponding span is an identity/isomorphism).</p>

<p>This is now not so much of a surprising condition, since we‚Äôve already seen that this left-adjoint condition is what ensures that profunctors are actually functors!</p>

<p>What happens then, we may well ask, if we don‚Äôt ask for this condition?
We recover the idea of a <strong>Mealy morphism</strong>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

TI"@I haven't posted anything in a while, and rather than trying to write about maths, I wanted to just share some lovely photos of Skomer island (which I recently visited).
I am even less knowledgeable about birds than I am about maths, but I do love them, and this was the first time in my life that I'd actually seen a puffin in the flesh!

<!-- more -->

---

I am from North Devon, and just off the coast there is a small island called [Lundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundy), which has a very interesting history, but is also famous for being the home to one of the few Atlantic puffin colonies in the British Isles.[^1]
In the last few decades, sadly, the number of breeding pairs of puffins has been in sharp decline, and when I went over there about 10 years ago I didn't see a single one.
Thanks to lots of work by dedicated volunteers, it seems like the puffin population of Lundy is slowly on the rise again, and so hopefully the future will see the return of Lundy as a puffin sanctuary.

Just off the west coast of Wales, in Pembrokeshire, there is another island famous for its fauna: [Skomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skomer).
As well as housing about half of the world's population of [Manx shearwaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_shearwater)[^2], being the unique home of the [Skomer vole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skomer_vole), and having numerous other species of birds, seals, and rabbits, it also has the largest puffin colony in southern Britain.

Puffins are extremely cute[^3] birds who mate for life, returning to the same burrows each year in order to find their partner, mate, and then leave (flying solo to the northern seas) for six or seven months, before coming back the next April.
To quote from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_puffin),

>Spending the autumn and winter in the open ocean of the cold northern seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas at the start of the breeding season in late spring.
>It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid.
>The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly.
>After about 6 weeks, it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea.
>It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.

As of 2015, the Atlantic puffin is rated 'vulnerable' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and was reported as being 'threatened with extinction' by BirdLife International in 2018.

TI"*Having recently been thinking about twisting cochains (a major part of my thesis) a bit more, I think I better understand one reason why they are very useful (and why they were first introduced by Bondal and Kapranov), and that's in 'fixing' a small quirk about dg-categories that I didn't quite understand way back when I wrote [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-26-derived-dg-triangulated-and-infinity-categories %}) about derived, dg-, and $$A_\infty$$-categories and their role in 'homotopy things'.

This isn't a long post and could probably instead be a tweet but then this blog would be a veritable ghost town.

<!-- more -->

---

First of all, for the actual definitions of twisting/twisted cochains/complexes (the nomenclature varies wildly and seemingly inconsistently),[^7] I will shamelessly refer the interested reader to ~~some notes I wrote a while back~~. (update: these notes have been subsumed into my PhD thesis)

Secondly, the 'quirk' of dg-categories about which I'm talking[^1] is that, for a lot of people[^2], it is the (pre-)triangulated structure that is interesting.
This means that (as far as I am aware)[^3] an arbitrary dg-category lacks some sort of homotopic interpretation because it has no structure corresponding to _stability_ 'upstairs'.
Twisting cochains then, as they were introduced by Bondal and Kapranov[^4], are a sort of solution to this problem, in that (to quote from where else but the nLab) _"passing from a dg-category to its category of twisted complexes is a step towards enhancing it to a pretriangulated dg-category"_.[^5]
In essence, they give us the 'smallest' 'bigger' dg-category in which we have shifts and functorial cones.

Really I am just parroting back the reasons why these things were initially invented, but it's something that I hadn't fully appreciated, since I've been working with specific types of twisted complexes (ones that somehow correspond to projective/free things and concentrated in a single degree) that really arise in what appears (to me) to be a completely different manner: namely in the setting of (O'Brian), Toledo, and Tong[^6] where they are (to be vague) thought of as resolutions of coherent sheaves, or first-order perturbations of certain bicomplexes by flat connections.

I really have no geometric/homotopic intuition as to why this specific case of twisted complexes corresponds thusly, and haven't been able to find any references at all.
Any ideas?

        <p>Having recently been thinking about twisting cochains (a major part of my thesis) a bit more, I think I better understand one reason why they are very useful (and why they were first introduced by Bondal and Kapranov), and that‚Äôs in ‚Äòfixing‚Äô a small quirk about dg-categories that I didn‚Äôt quite understand way back when I wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-26-derived-dg-triangulated-and-infinity-categories %}">this post</a> about derived, dg-, and <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-categories and their role in ‚Äòhomotopy things‚Äô.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt a long post and could probably instead be a tweet but then this blog would be a veritable ghost town.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>First of all, for the actual definitions of twisting/twisted cochains/complexes (the nomenclature varies wildly and seemingly inconsistently),<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I will shamelessly refer the interested reader to ~~some notes I wrote a while back~~. (update: these notes have been subsumed into my PhD thesis)</p>

<p>Secondly, the ‚Äòquirk‚Äô of dg-categories about which I‚Äôm talking<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> is that, for a lot of people<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, it is the (pre-)triangulated structure that is interesting.
This means that (as far as I am aware)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup> an arbitrary dg-category lacks some sort of homotopic interpretation because it has no structure corresponding to <em>stability</em> ‚Äòupstairs‚Äô.
Twisting cochains then, as they were introduced by Bondal and Kapranov<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, are a sort of solution to this problem, in that (to quote from where else but the nLab) <em>‚Äúpassing from a dg-category to its category of twisted complexes is a step towards enhancing it to a pretriangulated dg-category‚Äù</em>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
In essence, they give us the ‚Äòsmallest‚Äô ‚Äòbigger‚Äô dg-category in which we have shifts and functorial cones.</p>

<p>Really I am just parroting back the reasons why these things were initially invented, but it‚Äôs something that I hadn‚Äôt fully appreciated, since I‚Äôve been working with specific types of twisted complexes (ones that somehow correspond to projective/free things and concentrated in a single degree) that really arise in what appears (to me) to be a completely different manner: namely in the setting of (O‚ÄôBrian), Toledo, and Tong<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">7</a></sup> where they are (to be vague) thought of as resolutions of coherent sheaves, or first-order perturbations of certain bicomplexes by flat connections.</p>

<p>I really have no geometric/homotopic intuition as to why this specific case of twisted complexes corresponds thusly, and haven‚Äôt been able to find any references at all.
Any ideas?</p>

TI";In my thesis, switching between vector bundles and principal $$\mathrm{GL}_r$$-bundles has often made certain problems easier (or harder) to understand.
Due to my innate fear of all things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz's (absolutely fantastic) book [Principal Bundles ‚Äî The Classical Case](https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642), I've really grown quite fond of bundles, especially when you start talking about all the lovely $$\mathbb{B}G$$ and $$\mathbb{E}G$$ things therein[^1][^3].
Point is, I haven't posted anything in forever, and one of my supervisor's strong pedagogical beliefs is that _'affine vector spaces should be understood as $$G$$-torsors, where $$G$$ is the underlying vector space acting via translation'_,[^4] which makes a nice short topic of discussion, whence this post.

We briefly[^2] recall the definition of a principal $$G$$-bundle over a space $$X$$, where $$G$$ is some _topological_ group.

**Definition.** A _principal $$G$$-bundle over $$X$$_ is a fibre bundle $$P\xrightarrow{\pi}X$$ with a continuous right action $$P\times G\to P$$ such that

1. $$G$$ acts _freely_;
2. $$G$$ acts _transitively_ on the orbits; and
3. $$G$$ acts _properly_.

It is maybe helpful to think of the following 'dictionary':

+ free = injective (i.e. $$\exists x$$ s.t. $$gx=hx\implies g=h$$)
+ transitively = surjective (i.e. $$\forall x,y$$ $$\exists g$$ s.t. $$gx=y$$)
+ properly = something that you care about if you care about infinite sequences or Hausdorffness or things like that (i.e. the inverse image of $$G\times X\to X\times X$$ given by $$(g,x)\mapsto(gx,x)$$ preserves compactness)

Thus the fibres $$F$$ are homeomorphic to $$G$$, and also give the orbits, and the orbit space $$P/G$$ is homeomorphic to $$X$$.

Another definition is now useful.

**Definition.** A _$$G$$-torsor_ is a space upon which $$G$$ acts _freely_ and _transitively_.

**Motto.** $$G$$-torsors _are_ principal $$G$$-bundles over a point _are_ affine versions of $$G$$.

What do we mean by this last 'equivalence'?
Just that $$G$$-torsors retain all the structure of $$G$$, but don't have some specified point that acts as the identity.
Here are some nice examples.

+ $$\mathrm{GL}_r$$-torsors are vector spaces; $$\mathrm{GL}_r$$-bundles are vector bundles.
+ $$O(r)$$-torsors are vector spaces with an inner product.
+ $$\mathrm{GL}_r^+$$-torsors are oriented vector spaces (where $$\mathrm{GL}_r^+$$ is the connected component of $$\mathrm{GL}_r$$ consisting of matrices with determinant strictly positive).
+ $$\mathrm{SL}_r$$-torsors are vector spaces with a specified isomorphism $$\det V\xrightarrow{\sim} k$$, where $$\det V:=\wedge_{i=1}^r V$$, and $$k$$ is our base field. Note that this is weaker than a choice of basis: it is a choice of an $$\mathrm{SL}_r$$-conjugacy class of bases.

Due to my innate fear of all things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz‚Äôs (absolutely fantastic) book <a href="https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642">Principal Bundles ‚Äî The Classical Case</a>, I‚Äôve really grown quite fond of bundles, especially when you start talking about all the lovely <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}G</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{E}G</script> things therein<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Point is, I haven‚Äôt posted anything in forever, and one of my supervisor‚Äôs strong pedagogical beliefs is that <em>‚Äòaffine vector spaces should be understood as <script type="math/tex">G</script>-torsors, where <script type="math/tex">G</script> is the underlying vector space acting via translation‚Äô</em>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> which makes a nice short topic of discussion, whence this post.</p>

<hr />

<p>We briefly<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">4</a></sup> recall the definition of a principal <script type="math/tex">G</script>-bundle over a space <script type="math/tex">X</script>, where <script type="math/tex">G</script> is some <em>topological</em> group.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A <em>principal <script type="math/tex">G</script>-bundle over <script type="math/tex">X</script></em> is a fibre bundle <script type="math/tex">P\xrightarrow{\pi}X</script> with a continuous right action <script type="math/tex">P\times G\to P</script> such that</p>

<ol>
  <li><script type="math/tex">G</script> acts <em>freely</em>;</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">G</script> acts <em>transitively</em> on the orbits; and</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">G</script> acts <em>properly</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is maybe helpful to think of the following ‚Äòdictionary‚Äô:</p>

<ul>
  <li>free = injective (i.e. <script type="math/tex">\exists x</script> s.t. <script type="math/tex">gx=hx\implies g=h</script>)</li>
  <li>transitively = surjective (i.e. <script type="math/tex">\forall x,y</script> <script type="math/tex">\exists g</script> s.t. <script type="math/tex">gx=y</script>)</li>
  <li>properly = something that you care about if you care about infinite sequences or Hausdorffness or things like that (i.e. the inverse image of <script type="math/tex">G\times X\to X\times X</script> given by <script type="math/tex">(g,x)\mapsto(gx,x)</script> preserves compactness)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus the fibres <script type="math/tex">F</script> are homeomorphic to <script type="math/tex">G</script>, and also give the orbits, and the orbit space <script type="math/tex">P/G</script> is homeomorphic to <script type="math/tex">X</script>.</p>

<p>Another definition is now useful.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A <em><script type="math/tex">G</script>-torsor</em> is a space upon which <script type="math/tex">G</script> acts <em>freely</em> and <em>transitively</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Motto.</strong> <script type="math/tex">G</script>-torsors <em>are</em> principal <script type="math/tex">G</script>-bundles over a point <em>are</em> affine versions of <script type="math/tex">G</script>.</p>

<p>What do we mean by this last ‚Äòequivalence‚Äô?
Just that <script type="math/tex">G</script>-torsors retain all the structure of <script type="math/tex">G</script>, but don‚Äôt have some specified point that acts as the identity.
Here are some nice examples.</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r</script>-torsors are vector spaces; <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r</script>-bundles are vector bundles.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">O(r)</script>-torsors are vector spaces with an inner product.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r^+</script>-torsors are oriented vector spaces (where <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r^+</script> is the connected component of <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r</script> consisting of matrices with determinant strictly positive).</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\mathrm{SL}_r</script>-torsors are vector spaces with a specified isomorphism <script type="math/tex">\det V\xrightarrow{\sim} k</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\det V:=\wedge_{i=1}^r V</script>, and <script type="math/tex">k</script> is our base field. Note that this is weaker than a choice of basis: it is a choice of an <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{SL}_r</script>-conjugacy class of bases.</li>
</ul>

_Notational note:_ we write $$\mathcal{C}(x,y)$$ instead of $$\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(x,y)$$.



## Localisation of categories

Let $$(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{W})$$ be a pair, with $$\mathcal{C}$$ a category and $$\mathcal{W}$$ a wide subcategory (that is, a subcategory containing all the objects of $$\mathcal{C}$$, or, equivalently, a set of morphisms in $$\mathcal{C}$$).
This data is known as a _relative category_, which is a weaker version of a category with weak equivalences, or a homotopical category, or other such notions.

Often we want to _localise_ $$\mathcal{C}$$ along $$\mathcal{W}$$, i.e. 'formally invert all morphisms in $$\mathcal{W}$$'.
A nice way of making this rigorous is by defining the localisation $$\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$$ (also written $$\operatorname{Ho}(\mathcal{C})$$ or $$W^{-1}\mathcal{C}$$)[^3] by a universal property:[^4]

$$\begin{array}{lcr}
    \mathcal{C} & \xrightarrow{\mathcal{W}\,\mapsto\,\text{iso}_\mathcal{D}} & \mathcal{D}\\
    \quad\searrow & & \nearrow_{\exists!}\\
    & \mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}] &
\end{array}$$

That is, any category (along with a functor into it) such that all morphisms in $$\mathcal{W}$$ become isomorphisms _must_ factor _uniquely_ through $$\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$$.

Since our definition is in terms of a universal property, **if** the localisation of a category exists then it is unique.


### Gabriel-Zisman

There is a reasonably concrete way of constructing the localisation that is called _Gabriel-Zisman_ (or sometimes _zigzag_) _localisation_.
It has a few issues, which we discuss below, after giving a definition.
This is the localisation that most people will first study in the case of constructing the derived category of complexes, or some other such example, in a course on homological algebra or algebraic geometry.

We define the objects of $$\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$$ to be those of $$\mathcal{C}$$, and the morphisms to be _zigzags_ of morphisms: a morphism $$x\to y$$ is given by a directed graph whose vertices are objects of $$\mathcal{C}$$, and whose edges are labelled by arrows in $$\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{C})\sqcup\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{W}^\text{op})$$, **modulo certain equivalence relations**.[^1]
That is, a morphism from $$x=a_0$$ to $$y=a_{n+1}$$ is given by a string of objects $$a_1,\ldots,a_n\in\mathcal{C}$$ with maps between them: either a map $$a_i\to a_{i+1}$$ in $$\mathcal{C}$$, or a map $$a_i\leftarrow a_{i+1}$$ in $$\mathcal{W}$$.

Note that, if $$\mathcal{W}$$ contains all identity maps (for example), then we can always insert identity maps in our zigzags to ensure that they are always of the form $$f_1g_1\ldots f_ng_n$$ with $$f_i\in\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{C})$$ and $$g_i\in\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{W}^\text{op})$$.

As you can see, arbitrary morphisms in this category can be unreasonably large (in terms of the data describing them), and so we might hope that, by placing some conditions on $$\mathcal{W}$$, we can globally bound the length of the zigzags.
If fact, if $$\mathcal{W}$$ is a _[calculus of fractions](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/calculus+of+fractions#definition)_ then we can show that all the zigzags are actually just (co)roofs (depending on the handedness of the calculus of fractions):

$$x\to a\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}} y \quad\text{or}\quad x\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}a\to y.$$

Note that we **still** have an equivalence relation: two morphisms $$x\xleftarrow{\mathcal{W}}a\to y$$ and $$x\xleftarrow{\mathcal{W}}b\to y$$ are equivalent if there exists some roof $$a\xleftarrow{\mathcal{W}}e\to b$$ such that 'everything commutes'.[^2]

One potential problem with this construction (depending on how much you care about these things) is that the localisation might live only in some bigger universe, and so you have to start worrying about that.


### Dwyer-Kan

Of course, just constructing a category is not usually enough these days, and we instead want to give it some higher structure.
Enter _Dwyer-Kan_ (or _simplicial_) localisation.

This is a way of constructing an $$(\infty,1)$$-category $$L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}$$, realised as a _simplicial category_.
We talk more about simplicial categories later on, but first we quote Julia E. Bergner from ["A model category structure on the category of simplicial categories"](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406507):

_Note that the term ‚Äúsimplicial category‚Äù is potentially confusing. As we have already stated, by a simplicial category we mean a category enriched over simplicial sets._
_If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are objects in a simplicial category $$\mathcal{C}$$, then we denote by $$\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(a,b)$$ the function complex, or simplicial set of maps $$a\to b$$ in $$\mathcal{C}$$._
_This notion is more restrictive than that of a simplicial object in the category of categories._
_Using our definition, a simplicial category is essentially a simplicial object in the category of categories which satisfies the additional condition that all the simplicial operators induce the identity map on the objects of the categories involved._

First of all, note that we now require that $$(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{W})$$ be a _category with weak equivalences_: all isomorphisms are in $$\mathcal{W}$$, and if any two of $$\{f,g,g\circ f\}$$ are in $$\mathcal{W}$$ then so too is the third.
For example, any model category or homotopical category is automatically a category with weak equivalences.

Now then, the definition by universal property is (modulo some technical $$\infty$$-details) what you would expect: $$L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}$$ is an $$(\infty,1)$$-category such that $$\mathcal{C}$$ injects into $$L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}$$ with every morphism in $$\mathcal{W}$$ becoming an equivalence (in the $$(\infty,1)$$-sense) in $$L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}$$, and such that any other such $$(\infty,1)$$-category factors 'uniquely' through this.

One such way of constructing this localisation is by _hammock localisation_.
For any $$x,y\in\mathcal{C}$$ we define their $$\mathrm{Hom}$$ as the simplicial set $$L^\mathrm{H}(x,y)$$ given by

$$L^\mathrm{H}(x,y) := \coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{N}(\operatorname{H}_n(x,y))/\sim$$

where $$\mathcal{N}$$ is the nerve (which sends a category to a simplicial set), and both the categories $$\operatorname{H}_n(x,y)$$ and the equivalence relation $$\sim$$ remain to be defined.

For each $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ the category $$\operatorname{H}_n(x,y)$$ has objects being length-$$n$$ zigzags, as in Gabriel-Zisman localisation[^5], and the morphisms are 'hammocks'

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
    &&a_1&\to&a_2\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&a_n&\\
    &^{\small\mathcal{W}}\swarrow&&&&&&\searrow\\
    x&&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&&y\\
    &_{\small\mathcal{W}}\nwarrow&&&&&&\nearrow\\
    &&b_1&\to&b_2\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&b_n&
\end{array}$$

i.e. commutative diagrams of zigzags, where the 'linking' arrows are all in $$\mathcal{W}$$.
The equivalence relations are the 'natural' ones: we can insert or remove identity maps, and compose any composable morphisms.

### Comparison

Now then, we can ask how this 'new' localisation is related to the 'old' one, and we can answer this question with the following lemma.

**Lemma.** $$\pi_0(L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}(x,y))\simeq\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$$.

For this post, that's it, but my next post will talk about how we can extend these ideas to localise _quasi-categories_, and how the Bergner model structure on simplicial categories comes into the story.
This will, in particular, let us formalise the fact that taking the homotopy category of a category (whenever this makes sense, e.g. for quasi-categories) is somehow equivalent to localising the category along weak equivalences.
The lemma that we'll look at is the following (where we've yet to define the right-hand side).

**Lemma.** $$\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]\simeq\mathrm{h}L\mathcal{C}$$.

<p>First of all, note that we now require that <script type="math/tex">(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{W})</script> be a <em>category with weak equivalences</em>: all isomorphisms are in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>, and if any two of <script type="math/tex">\{f,g,g\circ f\}</script> are in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> then so too is the third.
For example, any model category or homotopical category is automatically a category with weak equivalences.</p>

<p>Now then, the definition by universal property is (modulo some technical <script type="math/tex">\infty</script>-details) what you would expect: <script type="math/tex">L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}</script> is an <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category such that <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> injects into <script type="math/tex">L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}</script> with every morphism in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> becoming an equivalence (in the <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-sense) in <script type="math/tex">L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}</script>, and such that any other such <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category factors ‚Äòuniquely‚Äô through this.</p>

<p>One such way of constructing this localisation is by <em>hammock localisation</em>.
For any <script type="math/tex">x,y\in\mathcal{C}</script> we define their <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Hom}</script> as the simplicial set <script type="math/tex">L^\mathrm{H}(x,y)</script> given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">L^\mathrm{H}(x,y) := \coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{N}(\operatorname{H}_n(x,y))/\sim</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}</script> is the nerve (which sends a category to a simplicial set), and both the categories <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{H}_n(x,y)</script> and the equivalence relation <script type="math/tex">\sim</script> remain to be defined.</p>

<p>For each <script type="math/tex">n\in\mathbb{N}</script> the category <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{H}_n(x,y)</script> has objects being length-<script type="math/tex">n</script> zigzags, as in Gabriel-Zisman localisation<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, and the morphisms are ‚Äòhammocks‚Äô</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
    &&a_1&\to&a_2\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&a_n&\\
    &^{\small\mathcal{W}}\swarrow&&&&&&\searrow\\
    x&&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&&y\\
    &_{\small\mathcal{W}}\nwarrow&&&&&&\nearrow\\
    &&b_1&\to&b_2\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&b_n&
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>i.e. commutative diagrams of zigzags, where the ‚Äòlinking‚Äô arrows are all in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>.
The equivalence relations are the ‚Äònatural‚Äô ones: we can insert or remove identity maps, and compose any composable morphisms.</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>Now then, we can ask how this ‚Äònew‚Äô localisation is related to the ‚Äòold‚Äô one, and we can answer this question with the following lemma.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> <script type="math/tex">\pi_0(L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}(x,y))\simeq\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]</script>.</p>

<p>For this post, that‚Äôs it, but my next post will talk about how we can extend these ideas to localise <em>quasi-categories</em>, and how the Bergner model structure on simplicial categories comes into the story.
This will, in particular, let us formalise the fact that taking the homotopy category of a category (whenever this makes sense, e.g. for quasi-categories) is somehow equivalent to localising the category along weak equivalences.
The lemma that we‚Äôll look at is the following (where we‚Äôve yet to define the right-hand side).</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]\simeq\mathrm{h}L\mathcal{C}</script>.</p>

        <p>After some exceptionally enlightening discussions with Eduard Balzin recently, I‚Äôve made some notes on the links between model categories, homotopy categories, and localisation, and how they all tie in together.
There‚Äôs nothing particularly riveting or original here, but hopefully these notes can help somebody else who was lost in this mire of ideas.</p>

<p><em>Notational note:</em> we write <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}(x,y)</script> instead of <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(x,y)</script>.</p>

<h2>Localisation of categories</h2>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{W})</script> be a pair, with <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> a category and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> a wide subcategory (that is, a subcategory containing all the objects of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>, or, equivalently, a set of morphisms in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>).
This data is known as a <em>relative category</em>, which is a weaker version of a category with weak equivalences, or a homotopical category, or other such notions.</p>

<p>Often we want to <em>localise</em> <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> along <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>, i.e. ‚Äòformally invert all morphisms in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>‚Äô.
A nice way of making this rigorous is by defining the localisation <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]</script> (also written <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{Ho}(\mathcal{C})</script> or <script type="math/tex">W^{-1}\mathcal{C}</script>)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">1</a></sup> by a universal property:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{lcr}
    \mathcal{C} & \xrightarrow{\mathcal{W}\,\mapsto\,\text{iso}_\mathcal{D}} & \mathcal{D}\\
    \quad\searrow & & \nearrow_{\exists!}\\
    & \mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}] &
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>That is, any category (along with a functor into it) such that all morphisms in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> become isomorphisms <em>must</em> factor <em>uniquely</em> through <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]</script>.</p>

<p>Since our definition is in terms of a universal property, <strong>if</strong> the localisation of a category exists then it is unique.</p>

<h3>Gabriel-Zisman</h3>

<p>There is a reasonably concrete way of constructing the localisation that is called <em>Gabriel-Zisman</em> (or sometimes <em>zigzag</em>) <em>localisation</em>.
It has a few issues, which we discuss below, after giving a definition.
This is the localisation that most people will first study in the case of constructing the derived category of complexes, or some other such example, in a course on homological algebra or algebraic geometry.</p>

<p>We define the objects of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]</script> to be those of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>, and the morphisms to be <em>zigzags</em> of morphisms: a morphism <script type="math/tex">x\to y</script> is given by a directed graph whose vertices are objects of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>, and whose edges are labelled by arrows in <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{C})\sqcup\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{W}^\text{op})</script>, <strong>modulo certain equivalence relations</strong>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
That is, a morphism from <script type="math/tex">x=a_0</script> to <script type="math/tex">y=a_{n+1}</script> is given by a string of objects <script type="math/tex">a_1,\ldots,a_n\in\mathcal{C}</script> with maps between them: either a map <script type="math/tex">a_i\to a_{i+1}</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>, or a map <script type="math/tex">a_i\leftarrow a_{i+1}</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>.</p>

<p>Note that, if <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> contains all identity maps (for example), then we can always insert identity maps in our zigzags to ensure that they are always of the form <script type="math/tex">f_1g_1\ldots f_ng_n</script> with <script type="math/tex">f_i\in\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{C})</script> and <script type="math/tex">g_i\in\operatorname{Arr}(\mathcal{W}^\text{op})</script>.</p>

<p>As you can see, arbitrary morphisms in this category can be unreasonably large (in terms of the data describing them), and so we might hope that, by placing some conditions on <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>, we can globally bound the length of the zigzags.
If fact, if <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> is a <em><a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/calculus+of+fractions#definition">calculus of fractions</a></em> then we can show that all the zigzags are actually just (co)roofs (depending on the handedness of the calculus of fractions):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x\to a\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}} y \quad\text{or}\quad x\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}a\to y.</script>

<p>Note that we <strong>still</strong> have an equivalence relation: two morphisms <script type="math/tex">x\xleftarrow{\mathcal{W}}a\to y</script> and <script type="math/tex">x\xleftarrow{\mathcal{W}}b\to y</script> are equivalent if there exists some roof <script type="math/tex">a\xleftarrow{\mathcal{W}}e\to b</script> such that ‚Äòeverything commutes‚Äô.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>One potential problem with this construction (depending on how much you care about these things) is that the localisation might live only in some bigger universe, and so you have to start worrying about that.</p>

<h3>Dwyer-Kan</h3>

<p>Of course, just constructing a category is not usually enough these days, and we instead want to give it some higher structure.
Enter <em>Dwyer-Kan</em> (or <em>simplicial</em>) localisation.</p>

<p>This is a way of constructing an <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category <script type="math/tex">L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}</script>, realised as a <em>simplicial category</em>.
We talk more about simplicial categories later on, but first we quote Julia E. Bergner from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406507">‚ÄúA model category structure on the category of simplicial categories‚Äù</a>:</p>

<p><em>Note that the term ‚Äúsimplicial category‚Äù is potentially confusing. As we have already stated, by a simplicial category we mean a category enriched over simplicial sets.</em>
<em>If <script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script> are objects in a simplicial category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>, then we denote by <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(a,b)</script> the function complex, or simplicial set of maps <script type="math/tex">a\to b</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script>.</em>
<em>This notion is more restrictive than that of a simplicial object in the category of categories.</em>
<em>Using our definition, a simplicial category is essentially a simplicial object in the category of categories which satisfies the additional condition that all the simplicial operators induce the identity map on the objects of the categories involved.</em></p>

<p>First of all, note that we now require that <script type="math/tex">(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{W})</script> be a <em>category with weak equivalences</em>: all isomorphisms are in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>, and if any two of <script type="math/tex">\{f,g,g\circ f\}</script> are in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> then so too is the third.
For example, any model category or homotopical category is automatically a category with weak equivalences.</p>

<p>Now then, the definition by universal property is (modulo some technical <script type="math/tex">\infty</script>-details) what you would expect: <script type="math/tex">L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}</script> is an <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category such that <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> injects into <script type="math/tex">L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}</script> with every morphism in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script> becoming an equivalence (in the <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-sense) in <script type="math/tex">L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}</script>, and such that any other such <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category factors ‚Äòuniquely‚Äô through this.</p>

<p>One such way of constructing this localisation is by <em>hammock localisation</em>.
For any <script type="math/tex">x,y\in\mathcal{C}</script> we define their <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Hom}</script> as the simplicial set <script type="math/tex">L^\mathrm{H}(x,y)</script> given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">L^\mathrm{H}(x,y) := \coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{N}(\operatorname{H}_n(x,y))/\sim</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}</script> is the nerve (which sends a category to a simplicial set), and both the categories <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{H}_n(x,y)</script> and the equivalence relation <script type="math/tex">\sim</script> remain to be defined.</p>

<p>For each <script type="math/tex">n\in\mathbb{N}</script> the category <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{H}_n(x,y)</script> has objects being length-<script type="math/tex">n</script> zigzags, as in Gabriel-Zisman localisation<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, and the morphisms are ‚Äòhammocks‚Äô</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
    &&a_1&\to&a_2\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&a_n&\\
    &^{\small\mathcal{W}}\swarrow&&&&&&\searrow\\
    x&&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&\downarrow_{\small\mathcal{W}}&&y\\
    &_{\small\mathcal{W}}\nwarrow&&&&&&\nearrow\\
    &&b_1&\to&b_2\xleftarrow{\small\mathcal{W}}&\ldots&b_n&
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>i.e. commutative diagrams of zigzags, where the ‚Äòlinking‚Äô arrows are all in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}</script>.
The equivalence relations are the ‚Äònatural‚Äô ones: we can insert or remove identity maps, and compose any composable morphisms.</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>Now then, we can ask how this ‚Äònew‚Äô localisation is related to the ‚Äòold‚Äô one, and we can answer this question with the following lemma.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> <script type="math/tex">\pi_0(L_\mathcal{W}\mathcal{C}(x,y))\simeq\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]</script>.</p>

<p>For this post, that‚Äôs it, but my next post will talk about how we can extend these ideas to localise <em>quasi-categories</em>, and how the Bergner model structure on simplicial categories comes into the story.

Lots of the talks have gone entirely above my head (reminding me how far behind my physics education has fallen), but have still been very interesting.

There was a talk yesterday on [$$\mathbb{F}_1$$ things](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/8635) by Matilde Marcolli, and on Tuesday a talk by Bertrand To√´n on [moduli spaces of connections on open varieties](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/8633) as well as one by Damien Calaque (my co-supervisor) on [$$\mathbb{E}_n$$-algebras and vertex models](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/8617), all of which I managed to follow at least partially (take what you can get, I guess).
Today, however, was a particularly interesting talk by Tobias Dyckerhoff on a [categorified Dold-Kan correspondence](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/8648).
I don't really want to talk about the details (because I'm not at all qualified to do so, and you'd be better served by going directly to the source), but something that I really enjoyed was a 'dictionary' that he presented.

Historically, the first step towards 'groupification' was the idea of enriching Betti numbers to abelian groups, which gave birth to what we now know as homology ‚Äî the Betti numbers are just the ranks of the groups.
Similarly, we now have the language to be able to ask that our abelian groups can actually be replaced by stable $$\infty$$-categories: we can turn homological algebra into _categorified homological algebra_, and, taking inspiration from Serge Lang's famous 'exercise' in homological algebra, we can pick up any textbook on homological algebra and try to categorify (and then prove) all the theorems.
To do so, we need to know what the classical constructions become in this higher-category language, whence the dictionary.

|classical|categorified|
|-|-|
|abelian group $$A$$|stable $$\infty$$-category $$\mathscr{A}$$|
|$$x\in A$$|$$X\in\mathscr{A}$$|
|$$y-x\in A$$|$$\operatorname{cone}(X\xrightarrow{f}Y)\in\mathscr{A}$$|
|$$\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i x_i\in A$$|$$\operatorname{Tot}(X_0\xrightarrow{f_0}\ldots\xrightarrow{f_{n-1}}X_n)\in\mathscr{A}$$|
|$$C\cong A\oplus B$$|$$\mathscr{C}\simeq\langle\mathscr{A},\mathscr{B}\rangle$$|
{:.bordered-table}

Note that the difference of two elements $$X,Y$$ in the categorified language depends on the choice of some morphism between them, so there are lots of 'values' of "$$X-Y$$", one for each $$f\colon X\to Y$$.
The last line (corresponding to a direct sum) is a semi-orthogonal decomposition.
Finally, we need to define what $$\mathrm{Tot}$$ is.

For $$n=1$$, we have already defined that $$\mathrm{Tot}$$ is given by $$\mathrm{cone}$$.
For $$n=2$$, we draw some punctured (i.e. missing one vertex) cube (see below) and take the colimit (which, thanks to stability, makes the cube actually _bi_cartesian).
For $$n=3$$ we embed the above cube as the face of a 4-dimensional cube, and take a colimit, etc. etc.

T;U;[0I"˛<p>So I‚Äôm currently at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, for a conference on ‚ÄòHigher algebra and mathematical physics‚Äô.
Lots of the talks have gone entirely above my head (reminding me how far behind my physics education has fallen), but have still been very interesting.</p>

To give some mathematical content to this post, here are a few of the questions on math.stackexchange/mathoverflow that I've come back to read time and time again, because they just float my boat:

- [In (relatively) simple words: What is an inverse limit?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38517/in-relatively-simple-words-what-is-an-inverse-limit/38522#38522)
- [Prove: if a,b in G commute with probability > 5/8, then G is abelian](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/846217/prove-if-a-b-in-g-commute-with-probability-5-8-then-g-is-abelian) and [5/8 bound in group theory](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/91685/5-8-bound-in-group-theory).
- [Optimal strategy for Jackpot Rock Paper Scissors](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/782448/optimal-strategy-for-jackpot-rock-paper-scissors).
- [How to choose the smallest number not chosen?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2118796/how-to-choose-the-smallest-number-not-chosen)
- [Riddles that can be solved by meta-assumptions](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2647300/riddles-that-can-be-solved-by-meta-assumptions).
- [Quickest way to determine a polynomial with positive integer coefficients](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/446130/quickest-way-to-determine-a-polynomial-with-positive-integer-coefficients).

(In case you can't tell, I am fascinated by simple game theory and 'meta-riddles'.)

_This post could have many errors, and I don't understand the proofs for many of the things I vaguely imply; I just mildly believe._
_Please do let me know if there is anything grossly misleading or just plain wrong._

## Warnings

First of all, there are two points that I want to make about choices of language that I think are really very confusing.

1. When we talk about derived categories, we are using this word in the opposite sense to pretty much every other usage of the word in modern mathematics[^1]: a **derived category** is like a homotopy truncation (i.e. the $$\pi_0$$) of some thing with much higher homotopical data; a **derived scheme/stack/whatever** is something whose $$\pi_0$$ is the corresponding classical object.
    Derived 'algebraic/geometric objects' _have_ homotopy truncations; derived categories _are_ homotopy truncations.
2. When we quotient the category of chain complexes by the equivalence relation given by chain homotopy, we usually call the resulting category $$K(\mathcal{A})$$ the **homotopy category of chain complexes**.
    This is maybe not the best nomenclature, in some sense, because the category that 'truly' deserves this name is the _actual_ homotopy category of chain complexes $$\mathrm{Ho}\mathsf{Ch}(\mathcal{A})$$, which is, by definition, the derived category $$D(\mathcal{A})$$.
    Because of this, I won't refer to $$K(\mathcal{A})$$ as anything but $$K(\mathcal{A})$$.

## A nice diagram

Without further ado, here is a diagram that attempts to explain the relationships between various things that you might have learnt about in various places.

![How things all sort of fit together](/assets/post-images/2018-04-26-derived-dg-triangulated-and-infinity-categories-1.png "How things all sort of fit together")

Here are a few words about the above diagram.

- The structure of a _triangulated category_ is essentially the structure that the category $$\mathrm{Ho}(\mathcal{C})$$ inherits from the fact that $$\mathcal{C}$$ is a _stable_ $$(\infty,1)$$-category.
    The equivalent notion in the more general case (the left-hand side of the diagram) is the structure inherent to $$\mathrm{h}(\mathcal{C})$$ from an $$(\infty,1)$$-category viewed as a quasi-category (and thus, in particular, simplicial set).
- A _stable dg-category_ is also known as an _enhanced triangulated category_ or a _pretriangulated category_.
- If we wanted to draw a column in the middle for _stable_ $$(\infty,1)$$-categories that _aren't necessarily linear_, then we'd arrive at the notion of a _spectral category_ instead of a dg-category.

Now here is a picture of where the derived category of chain complexes fits in to all this.

![Where does the derived category fit in?](/assets/post-images/2018-04-26-derived-dg-triangulated-and-infinity-categories-2.png "Where does the derived category fit in?")

Here are a few words about the above diagram.

- We can understand the definition of _chain homotopies_ much better if we understand the idea of the [interval object in chain complexes](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/interval+object+in+chain+complexes).
- As said at the beginning of this post, there _is_ a difference between passing from $$\mathsf{Ch}(\mathcal{A})$$ to $$K(\mathcal{A})$$ and from $$K(\mathcal{A})$$ to $$D(\mathcal{A})$$, i.e. quotienting and localising have no reason to behave similarly[^2].
    _But_, there is a model structure that we can put on $$\mathsf{Ch}(\mathcal{A})$$, and so there _is_ some link between the two: to quote from [a mathoverflow answer by Simon Henry](https://mathoverflow.net/a/188199/73622),
    _"The reason why they give the same things in a lot of example (including chain complexes), giving the idea that they should be related, is because these examples are Quillen model categories and that it is the main result of Quillen's "Homotopical Algebra" (where he defined model categories) that for Quillen model category the localization by weak equialence can be constructed as a quotient of the full subcategory of fibrant-cofibrant objects."_

    There is, however, the slightly confusing fact that the construction of $$K(\mathcal{A})$$ as a quotient _does_ agree with a localisation construction (as explained [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1128937/71510)).

## Unresolved confusions

I still don't fully see the link between the homotopy category $$\mathrm{h}(\mathcal{C})$$ and the homotopy category $$\mathrm{Ho}(\mathcal{C})$$ and localisation in general (e.g. I 'know' that $$\mathrm{Ho}(\mathcal{C})(a,b)\simeq\pi_0(\mathrm{L}\mathcal{C}(a,b))$$, where $$\mathrm{L}$$ is the simplicial localisation, but that's about it).

You know what?
There are a lot of things that I still don't understand, but oh my goodness am I having fun trying to figure it all out.

TI"~At a conference this week, I ended up having a conversation with Nicolas Vichery and Eduard Balzin about why simplices are the prevalent choice of geometric shape for higher structure, as opposed to e.g. cubes or globes.

<!-- more -->

---

I know there are a bunch of nice properties that simplices have that other shapes don't have[^1], and they seem to be the natural choice when you start thinking about higher categories as quasi-categories and filling of horns etc., but I always thought that simplices were badly behaved with respect to taking products.[^4]
Nicolas, however, showed me a great little calculation that solves this problem.
Neither I nor some of the other people I spoke to had seen this before, so I thought it would be worth spreading the word.

If we take the (geometric realisation of the) 1-cube (the interval $$[0,1]$$), then we can take the product with itself to get $$[0,1]\times[0,1]$$, which is automatically the 2-cube.
More generally, any product of cubes will itself be a cube.
For simplices, however, this is not at all immediate: think of the problem of trying to find a triangulation for a product of spaces when calculating simplicial homology in an undergraduate course, for example.
Explicitly, if we take the product of the (geometric realisations of) two 1-simplices (the interval $$[0,1]$$ again), then we, as above, get the space $$[0,1]\times[0,1]$$, which is not a $$\Delta$$-complex (in the language of Hatcher).
To triangulate this space, we need to add a 1-simplex along the diagonal of the square.

![Cubes work, simplices don't](/assets/post-images/2018-04-11-triangulation-of-products-cubes-work.jpg "Cubes work, simplices don't")

This isn't too hard to see, but for arbitrary triangulations of spaces, it's much harder to see what extra simplices we need to add to their product to recover a triangulation.
Even if we _can_ figure out how to do it for hard examples, then we still would need a way to describe an algorithm for doing it to _any_ product space.
But there is a 'trick', which works as follows: write your simplices as simplicial sets, **including degeneracies**,[^2] and then take the product in the category of simplicial sets.

Consider our example of $$\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$$, i.e. $$[0,1]\times[0,1]$$.
Define the simplicial set $$X_\bullet$$ by

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X_0 &= \{[0], [1]\}\\
    X_1 &= \{[0,0],[0,1],[1,1]\}\\
    X_2 &= \{[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,1,1]\}\\
    &\vdots
\end{aligned}
$$

that is, all simplices in degree 2 and higher are degenerate (and we include all of them); the 0-simplices correspond to the points 0 and 1; and the 1-simplices correspond to the line from 0 to 1, as well as the two degenerate 'lines' from 0 to 0 and from 1 to 1_.

When we apply geometric realisation, these degenerate simplices will 'vanish', and so we can just look at what the non-degenerate 1-simplices of $$X_\bullet\times X_\bullet$$ are to see what happens in terms of triangulation.
There are nine 1-simplices in the product:

$$
\begin{aligned}
   &[0,0]\times[0,0], \quad [0,0]\times[0,1], \quad [0,0]\times[1,1],\\
   &[0,1]\times[0,0], \quad [0,1]\times[0,1], \quad [0,1]\times[1,1],\\
   &[1,1]\times[0,0], \quad [1,1]\times[0,1], \quad [1,1]\times[1,1].
\end{aligned}
$$

Five of these are non-degenerate,[^3] and the one that interests us is $$[0,1]\times[0,1]$$: when we apply geometric realisation, this will be a 1-simplex along the diagonal of the square.

![The final result](/assets/post-images/2018-04-11-triangulation-of-products-result.jpg "The final result")

In essence, the idea is simple, but it's a trick that I'd never seen before, and it really makes me 'believe' in simplices.

TI"»]I am not at all a physicist, and my knowledge of quantum physics in particular comes solely from undergraduate courses that I followed years ago, and any reading I can get done when feeling mathematical but not inclined to work on my thesis.
However, after scanning through some papers by [Bartlett](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0512103), [Baez, Lauda](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2469), and [Lurie](https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465), my interest in quantum physics, and quantum computing especially, has come back with a vengeance.

<!-- more -->

---

_The following is aimed at people who have maybe read some things about quantum physics before and know some linear algebra._

Quantum computing has fascinated me ever since  I first studied it at university, despite being a self-proclaimed 'non-physicist', swearing to do only 'mathematical maths' and none of this applied stuff (a shameful phase that I am really glad I outgrew).
This is without a doubt almost entirely due to the incredible teaching of [Artur Ekert](http://www.arturekert.org), whose lectures were probably the best that I ever experienced as an undergrad/masters student.
Really, most of what I'm going to say comes from notes I took in these lectures, so hopefully I don't distort them too much.

One of the reasons that I'm posting this, apart from to help me to not forget it, is that quantum physics has such a strong link to $$n$$-category theory, but I don't know at all really how quantum computing fits into this [nPOV](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nPOV) picture.
As a naive guess, I would think that there is some `string diagram' approach to all this, but I'd need to sit down and have a think about what exactly that would be...
So if anybody has any comments or references then I'd be more that interested to hear them!

## Foundational ideas

Before jumping in to the jacuzzi that is quantum circuitry, let's dip our toes in the vast ocean of **quantum physics axiomatisation**.
First of all though, a note on quantum computers in practice.
There are a bunch of companies that make 'quantum computers' (for example the [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com)) but these are of a completely different species to those that we're going to have a look at.
These computers work using [quantum annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing) ‚Äì a sort of quantum version of [thermal annealing](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Simulated_annealing); what I'm going to talk about are [universal quantum computers](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quantum_Turing_machine).
Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the famous quantum algorithms, like Shor's, cannot be implemented in this way.Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the more well-known quantum algorithms, such as [Shor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm?oldformat=true), cannot be implemented in this way.
I hate to be a cynic about something in which I am far from an expert, but it seems to me that calling systems like the D-Wave 'quantum computers' is a way to boost sales by using not-entirely-false-but-definitely-misleading buzzwords.[^2]

Another very important point is that **quantum algorithm complexity** is by no means trivial.
Said in another way, there are some things that quantum computers can do so much better than classical ones (e.g. prime factorisation), but they are neither 'better' nor 'faster' overall: there are some things that they are much _worse_ at than classical computers.
Expecting a quantum computer to be able to run arbitrary programs quicker than a classical computer is somewhat akin to expecting an otter to be able to drink a pint of water quicker than a pigeon could, simply because an otter swims faster in water.[^3]

Anyway, with that aside, let's go get our feet wet.

### Quantum interference

Here is an experimental fact that you can read about in who-knows-how-many places and find numerous videos of: if we send a particle through a barrier with two tiny (really really tiny) holes (or _slits_, to agree with the name **double-slit experiment**) and place a detector on the other side, it is _not necessarily_ true that the particle reaches the detector with probability $$p_1+p_2$$, where $$p_i$$ is the probability of the particle going through the $$i$$-th hole.
In fact, the probability is given by

$$p_1 + p_2 + 2\sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2)$$

where $$\varphi_i$$ are numbers, called the **phase**, associated to the $$p_i$$ (we describe what exactly they are in a bit).
This means that the total probability depends on the **relative phase** of the system: the value $$\vert\varphi_1-\varphi_2\vert$$.
Sometimes this _will_ agree with $$p_1+p_2$$, and sometimes _not_.

The point is, the **Kolmogorov additivity axiom** (the probability of two _mutually exclusive_ events is the sum of the probabilities of the constituent events) seems to fail ‚Äì but why?
As a result of decades of thinking and experiments and failed ideas, the theory that seems the 'most likely' is that of **quantum theory**, which says in particular that _the particle passes through both slits simultaneously_, and so the events of passing through each slit individually are _not_ mutually exclusive at all.
This does seem to explain the formula for the probability of detection that we described above: the only way that it can depend on $$\varphi_1-\varphi_2$$ is if the particle 'interacts' with both paths each time it passes through the barrier.

I'm not going to talk much more about actual quantum physics, since there are so many great references written about it already, and I am also not a physicist, and even less so an experimental quantum physicist.
However, it's good to have this basic understanding of quantum physics to really understand how quantum computers work: in some sense that we will make precise, they follow _all_ computational paths at the same time, and give an answer that depends on _all_ of the results.

It is very natural, reading this, to wonder why it is that we don't experience quantum effects in our daily lives.[^1]
You can try throwing a ball at a wall with two open windows as much as you want, but you'll never have it go through both windows simultaneously.
The answer is the very thing that's stopping us from being able to actually build quantum computers with our current technology: **decoherence**.
Simply put, no physical system is really truly separate from the external environment ‚Äì there is always gravity of far away objects pulling on things, and even being able to _look_ at a physical system means that there are photons passing through and touching things and generally being a nuisance.
Decoherence, then, is when the external environment 'gets in the way' of our very delicate teeny tiny quantum systems, and influences the **interference term** (the term with the relative phase) in such a way that we can't recover it.
This also ties in with the fact that, given any 'quantum theorem' (i.e. formula or equation for a quantum system), if we make all the 'quantum terms' tend to zero then we should recover the corresponding 'classical theorem'.
Later on we will talk about decoherence again, and look at what it means explicitly in terms of quantum circuits, but to begin with we just sort of ignore it and work in an ideal world where we can get rid of it entirely.

### Axiomatics

In our discussion of the double-slit experiment we mentioned how there were 'extra' numbers $$\varphi_i$$ associated to the probabilities $$p_i$$, so let's try to formalise that now.
Quantum theory suggests that we work with **probability amplitudes** instead of **probabilities**.
That is, rather than just saying an event happens with probability $$p$$ for some real number $$0\leqslant p\leqslant1$$, we say that it has **associated probability amplitude $$z$$**, where $$z$$ is some complex number such that $$\vert z\vert\leqslant1$$, and then the probability of the event occurring is exactly $$|z|$$.
The way that amplitudes behave are very similar to they ways that probabilities behave: the amplitude associated to two events occurring one after the other is the _product_ $$z_1z_2$$ of their probability amplitudes; the amplitude associated to an event that can occur in two different ways it the sum $$z_1+z_2$$ of the amplitudes associated to the individual ways.
In fact, writing our complex numbers as $$z=|z|e^{i\varphi}$$, we can recover the probability in the double-slit experiment:

$$|z_1+z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + z_1^*z_2 + z_1z_2^* = p_1 + p_2 + 2\sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2).$$

The other generalisation of classical things that we work with is the idea of a **qubit**.
The classical idea of a **bit** is that we can store information by encoding things in binary and then, for example, inducing a charge between the plates of a capacitor to represent a 1, and leaving it uncharged to represent a 0.
To make this quantum, we can look at storing our data not on capacitors but on electrons, or using polarisation of light.
For example, we could say that an electron in its **ground state** (its lowest energy state) represents a 0, and if it's in a higher energy state then it represents a 1.
So far so good, but what's new?
Well, by shining light of varying frequencies and brightness for varying durations, we can change the electron's energy state, but if we shine light at, for example, half the brightness, then we will find that our electron is now in a state that can't be described classically: it's in a **coherent superposition** of states.
These are states where the electron is in _both energy levels at once_, similar to how the particle went through both slits at once.

Again, I'm not really the best person to explain this, but the idea is that, experimentally, we can prepare particles in such a way that, when we measure their energy, sometimes we find that they're in their ground state, and other times they're in their higher energy state (and anything that we can prepare consistently like this we call a **qubit**; we call one of the states $$\vert0\rangle$$ and the other $$\vert1\rangle$$).[^4]
But, you may be saying, how do we know that it isn't simply the case that some of the particles we prepare are already in one state, and the others in another state?
That is, imagine the two following scenarios:

1. We have an electron in an 'equal' superposition (it's in both states 'in equal amounts') and we measure its energy
2. We have a bag containing two electrons, one in state $$\vert0\rangle$$ and the other in state $$\vert1\rangle$$. We pick one randomly and measure its energy.

In both cases, when we measure the energy of the particle we will find it to be in state $$\vert0\rangle$$ or state $$\vert1\rangle$$ with equal probability (50%), so how does this supposed 'superposition particle' differ from a particle with a randomly picked state?
Well, experimentally, we can show a difference, but maybe more convincingly we can give a good mathematical reason why these two situations are completely different.
To do so _properly_, we need at least the basics of quantum circuitry, but we can describe the proof right now.

If it were the case that sending a pulse of light at the electron that puts it in a 50/50 superposition were the same as simply setting the electron to state $$\vert0\rangle$$ or $$\vert1\rangle$$ randomly, then firing this same beam of light _twice_ in a row at the same electron should be the same as firing it once.
In other words, if we randomly set it to 0 or 1, and then randomly set it _again_ to 0 or 1, it's the same as randomly setting it to 0 or 1 just once.
_But_ (and here's the kicker), we can show that _every single time_ you start with an electron in state $$\vert0\rangle$$ and hit it with this pulse of light two times in a row, what you actually end up with is an electron in state $$\vert1\rangle$$.
_Every single time._
It's a hard thing to understand when you first meet it (and still even after the second and third encounters), but coherent superpositions are not at all the same as a particle being in a randomly chosen state ‚Äì it really is a particle that is in both states at once.

There is a bunch of really exciting 'quantum philosophy' that asks questions like, "if quantum theory is wrong in some way, then can any of it still be right, or does it all break down if we find one problem?", and "how can we tell that there isn't a _hidden variable_?", i.e. "how do we know that the result of our measurement of a particle isn't predetermined?".
What is really astonishing is that quantum theory is in some sense more general and powerful that quantum theory.
What do I mean by this?
Well, as an example that I still think about in awe, even if quantum theory is completely entirely 'wrong', in that the universe works by some entirely different theory, then we can _still_ use quantum physics to produce truly random data.
This doesn't sound very exciting or big, but if you say it in a different way you can see why people would get so worked up about it: _if all of our lab equipment is made by some private corporation that we don't trust, and we want to produce a random number, then using quantum physics we can do so with **complete certainty**,[^10] even if the equipment has been tampered with to produce certain states of particles more often than others, or to produce seemingly random states that are actually just following a predetermined order._

I don't want to be turning quantum physics into sensationalism now, so this comes with the obvious caveat that doing things in practice is usually really hard.
A quote I remember hearing from Artur is that _"in theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is"_.
But, even so, wow this stuff is cool.

Awed ravings aside,[^5] let's briefly end this section on axiomatisation by actually stating what our axiomatisation is.
This isn't going to be entirely self-contained for those new to maths I'm afraid ‚Äì I'm going to freely talk about vector spaces and complex numbers and matrices and the like (basically, _linear algebra over $$\mathbb{C}$$_).

The following is all experimentally inspired and guided, but it still a purely _mathematical_ formalism.
So far it seems to agree with every physical experiment we can throw at it, but we won't worry too much about this, and instead just see what happens if we play around with the maths, and leave physical implementations to the physicists (though we won't forget that, whenever something seems to pop up out of thin air, it's almost always because it's been suggested to exist by some experimental experiences).

1. A **qubit** is any object that can be reliably prepared to be in one of two states (or any superposition therein), manipulated, and measured.
    Any qubit can be described by a **state vector**:[^6] a qubit in state $$\vert0\rangle$$ with probability amplitude $$\alpha_0$$ and state $$\vert1\rangle$$ with probability amplitude $$\alpha_1$$ is represented by the unit vector with entries $$\alpha_0$$ and $$\alpha_1$$

    $$\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle \longleftrightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\alpha_0\\\alpha_1\end{pmatrix}.$$

    This means that the qubit is in an $$\alpha_0\colon\alpha_1$$ coherent superposition, and so when measured it will be in state $$\vert0\rangle$$ with probability $$\vert\alpha_0\vert^2$$ and in state $$\vert1\rangle$$ with probability $$\vert\alpha_1\vert^2$$.

    Note that we ignore **global phase**: if we have a qubit in the state $$e^{i\vartheta}(\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle)$$ then this is the same as a qubit in the state $$\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle$$.
    We do **not**, however, ignore **local phase**: $$\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + e^{i\vartheta}\alpha\vert1\rangle$$ is **not** the same as $$\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle$$.

2. Qubits are modified by **quantum evolutions**: redistributions of the amplitudes between the states (for example, the changes of energy induced by pulses of light on an electron qubit).
    Admissible quantum evolutions are described by complex isometries, in particular by **unitary matrices**.
    For example, the matrix

    $$\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}$$

    sends the basis state $$\vert0\rangle$$ to $$\vert1\rangle$$, and the basis state $$\vert1\rangle$$ to $$-\vert0\rangle$$, and extends linearly to act on any superposition $$\vert\Psi\rangle = \alpha_0\vert0\rangle + \alpha_1\vert1\rangle$$.

3. We take **measurements** corresponding to our choice of basis states $$\vert0\rangle$$ and $$\vert1\rangle$$.
    As mentioned above, the probability of the outcomes of any measurement are given by the moduli of the probability amplitudes, and the choice of basis consists of distinguishable states, so the outcomes of any measurement are mutually exclusive.[^7]

4. For multiple qubits (and composite systems in general), the corresponding state vectors are the unit vectors in the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces associated to each individual system, e.g. a system consisting of two qubits is described by the complex Hilbert space $$\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$$, and so state vectors are of the form
    
    $$\begin{pmatrix}\alpha_0\\\alpha_1\end{pmatrix}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}\beta_0\\\beta_1\end{pmatrix}.$$

    The evolutions are then described by tensor products of the relevant unitary matrices.

    **Edit.** More about this at the end of the post.

&nbsp;

Finally, for this section, an important note on measurements and the troublesome notion of **collapsing**.
When we have some particle in a coherent superposition and then measure it, we find it in state $$\vert0\rangle$$ with probability $$\vert\alpha_0\vert$$.
But then, after the measurement, the particle is in state $$\vert0\rangle$$, _full stop_; there is now no uncertainty, and we know that we can measure this particle over and over and always find it in state $$\vert0\rangle$$.
Even more worryingly, the original state $$\alpha_0\vert0\rangle+\alpha_1\vert1\rangle$$ is completely irretrievable.
This seems to be a contradiction to our assumptions on quantum evolutions: this 'collapse' that follows a measurement is not described by a hermitian operator (in particular, it's not invertible, since we lose the original state), but instead something far more blunt and sudden.

There are many ways of dealing with this problem, but the important thing to note is that measurements can still be described in exactly the same way as all other quantum processes, and aren't subject to a different axiomatisation or something.[^8]
However, for the moment, it's a convenient way of thinking that simplifies the maths (and conceptualisation) to just think of measurements as collapses.

## Classical circuits

Finally for this post, we'll talk a bit about classical circuits.
Let's take a single bit, which can be in one of two states: $$\vert0\rangle$$ (off) and $$\vert1\rangle$$ (on).
Using the same notation as before, we can use a 2-vector to describe the state of this bit:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix} \,\,\leftrightarrow\, &\vert0\rangle \leftrightarrow \text{off}\\
    \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix} \,\,\leftrightarrow\, &\vert1\rangle \leftrightarrow \text{on}.
\end{aligned}$$

Then we can describe the four classical computations on a single bit by matrices:

$$\begin{array}{cccc}
    \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix}\\[1em]
    \text{IDENTITY} & \text{NOT} & \text{CONSTANT-0} & \text{CONSTANT-1}
\end{array}$$

If we have two bits, we can use that $$\mathbb{R}^2\otimes\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{R}^4$$ to write state vectors in the form

$$\begin{pmatrix}\delta_a\\1-\delta_a\end{pmatrix}\otimes \begin{pmatrix}\delta_b\\1-\delta_b\end{pmatrix} \longleftrightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\delta_a\otimes\delta_b\\\delta_a\otimes(1-\delta_b)\\(1-\delta_a)\otimes\delta_b\\(1-\delta_a)\otimes(1-\delta_b)\end{pmatrix}$$

for $$\delta_a,\delta_b\in\{0,1\}$$.

Then, for example, a gate that acts as NOT on the first bit and as the CONSTANT1 gate on the second bit would be given by[^9] the matrix

$$\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} \otimes \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&0\\0&0&1&1\\0&0&0&0\\1&1&0&0\end{pmatrix}.$$

---

**Edit.** Somehow I forgot to talk about **entanglement**, so let me fix that now with a small update.

When we have a multi-particle system (e.g. two qubits), then the states of this joint system are described by tensor products, as we said in our four-point axiomatisation.
This means that states of the form

$$\vert0\rangle\otimes\vert0\rangle = \vert0\rangle\vert0\rangle = \vert00\rangle$$

(where the latter two equalities are just us introducing some shorthand notation) describe our system.
However, not every element of a tensor product is a tensor of elements in each component: they are _linear combinations_ of such things.
For example,

$$\alpha\vert00\rangle + \beta\vert01\rangle = \vert0\rangle\otimes(\alpha\vert0\rangle + \beta\vert1\rangle)$$

but

$$\alpha\vert00\rangle + \beta\vert11\rangle$$

_cannot_ be written in the form $$\vert \Psi_a\rangle\otimes\vert \Psi_b\rangle$$.

We call states in the former form (tensors of states of the composite systems) **pure states**, and the latter form (states that don't 'split' as a state in each composite system) **entangled states**, because somehow the two systems are interacting with each other in such a way that we can't 'pull them apart'.

# Footnotes

[^1]: Well, in some way we _do_, because quantum theory governs fundamental actions of particles themselves, which sort of make up everything, so of course we're affected. But what I mean here is that we don't tend to see things in two places at once, or witness 'mutually exclusive' events simultaneously.
[^2]: In general, it seems that quantum physics shares the fate of G√∂del's incompleteness theorems ‚Äì to be misquoted and misapplied for the purpose of sensationalism.
[^3]: To be fair, I have neither witnessed an otter-pigeon swimming race nor an otter-pigeon drinking race, so this could be a flawed analogy.
[^4]: So, in our example, an electron in its ground state is said to be in state $$\vert0\rangle$$, and in its higher energy state its said to be in state $$\vert1\rangle$$,
[^5]: Enthusiasm isn't a substitute for knowledge, so I really hope that I haven't said anything misleading here. If it were the case that being really excited about everything counted the same as understanding it all, then I'd be a much better mathematician.
[^6]: We always need a _choice of basis_, because this is equivalent to being able to interpret a qubit 'as a 0 or a 1'.
[^7]: This is a possible sticky wicket. A particle can be in a superposition of states, but any measurement will result in just _one_ state; we can't actually _observe_ a superposition. See the comments in a bit about measurement and collapse.
[^8]: What even _is_ measurement? The more you think about it and try to define it, the more you realise what a tricky concept it is. It's when an observer learns information about a quantum system, but then, what is an observer? And how do we formalise the idea of 'gaining information about something'? There is a lot of 'quantum philosophy' here, and many ways of answering these questions. Personally, I like the approach that captures the 'measurement collapse' as 'lots of decoherence', and describes decoherence as 'the universe trying to learn information about the quantum system'. Hopefully I'll write about this some other time, and try to find some good references by real physicists.
[^9]: The tensor product of matrices is given by the [Kronecker product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product).

T;U;[0I"Ts<p>I am not at all a physicist, and my knowledge of quantum physics in particular comes solely from undergraduate courses that I followed years ago, and any reading I can get done when feeling mathematical but not inclined to work on my thesis.
However, after scanning through some papers by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0512103">Bartlett</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2469">Baez, Lauda</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465">Lurie</a>, my interest in quantum physics, and quantum computing especially, has come back with a vengeance.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p><em>The following is aimed at people who have maybe read some things about quantum physics before and know some linear algebra.</em></p>

<p>Quantum computing has fascinated me ever since  I first studied it at university, despite being a self-proclaimed ‚Äònon-physicist‚Äô, swearing to do only ‚Äòmathematical maths‚Äô and none of this applied stuff (a shameful phase that I am really glad I outgrew).
This is without a doubt almost entirely due to the incredible teaching of <a href="http://www.arturekert.org">Artur Ekert</a>, whose lectures were probably the best that I ever experienced as an undergrad/masters student.
Really, most of what I‚Äôm going to say comes from notes I took in these lectures, so hopefully I don‚Äôt distort them too much.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that I‚Äôm posting this, apart from to help me to not forget it, is that quantum physics has such a strong link to <script type="math/tex">n</script>-category theory, but I don‚Äôt know at all really how quantum computing fits into this <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nPOV">nPOV</a> picture.
As a naive guess, I would think that there is some `string diagram‚Äô approach to all this, but I‚Äôd need to sit down and have a think about what exactly that would be‚Ä¶
So if anybody has any comments or references then I‚Äôd be more that interested to hear them!</p>

<h2>Foundational ideas</h2>

<p>Before jumping in to the jacuzzi that is quantum circuitry, let‚Äôs dip our toes in the vast ocean of <strong>quantum physics axiomatisation</strong>.
First of all though, a note on quantum computers in practice.
There are a bunch of companies that make ‚Äòquantum computers‚Äô (for example the <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com">D-Wave</a>) but these are of a completely different species to those that we‚Äôre going to have a look at.
These computers work using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing">quantum annealing</a> ‚Äì a sort of quantum version of <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Simulated_annealing">thermal annealing</a>; what I‚Äôm going to talk about are <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quantum_Turing_machine">universal quantum computers</a>.
Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the famous quantum algorithms, like Shor‚Äôs, cannot be implemented in this way.Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the more well-known quantum algorithms, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm?oldformat=true">Shor‚Äôs</a>, cannot be implemented in this way.
I hate to be a cynic about something in which I am far from an expert, but it seems to me that calling systems like the D-Wave ‚Äòquantum computers‚Äô is a way to boost sales by using not-entirely-false-but-definitely-misleading buzzwords.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Another very important point is that <strong>quantum algorithm complexity</strong> is by no means trivial.
Said in another way, there are some things that quantum computers can do so much better than classical ones (e.g. prime factorisation), but they are neither ‚Äòbetter‚Äô nor ‚Äòfaster‚Äô overall: there are some things that they are much <em>worse</em> at than classical computers.
Expecting a quantum computer to be able to run arbitrary programs quicker than a classical computer is somewhat akin to expecting an otter to be able to drink a pint of water quicker than a pigeon could, simply because an otter swims faster in water.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Anyway, with that aside, let‚Äôs go get our feet wet.</p>

<h3>Quantum interference</h3>

<p>Here is an experimental fact that you can read about in who-knows-how-many places and find numerous videos of: if we send a particle through a barrier with two tiny (really really tiny) holes (or <em>slits</em>, to agree with the name <strong>double-slit experiment</strong>) and place a detector on the other side, it is <em>not necessarily</em> true that the particle reaches the detector with probability <script type="math/tex">p_1+p_2</script>, where <script type="math/tex">p_i</script> is the probability of the particle going through the <script type="math/tex">i</script>-th hole.
In fact, the probability is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_1 + p_2 + 2\sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\varphi_i</script> are numbers, called the <strong>phase</strong>, associated to the <script type="math/tex">p_i</script> (we describe what exactly they are in a bit).
This means that the total probability depends on the <strong>relative phase</strong> of the system: the value <script type="math/tex">\vert\varphi_1-\varphi_2\vert</script>.
Sometimes this <em>will</em> agree with <script type="math/tex">p_1+p_2</script>, and sometimes <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>The point is, the <strong>Kolmogorov additivity axiom</strong> (the probability of two <em>mutually exclusive</em> events is the sum of the probabilities of the constituent events) seems to fail ‚Äì but why?
As a result of decades of thinking and experiments and failed ideas, the theory that seems the ‚Äòmost likely‚Äô is that of <strong>quantum theory</strong>, which says in particular that <em>the particle passes through both slits simultaneously</em>, and so the events of passing through each slit individually are <em>not</em> mutually exclusive at all.
This does seem to explain the formula for the probability of detection that we described above: the only way that it can depend on <script type="math/tex">\varphi_1-\varphi_2</script> is if the particle ‚Äòinteracts‚Äô with both paths each time it passes through the barrier.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not going to talk much more about actual quantum physics, since there are so many great references written about it already, and I am also not a physicist, and even less so an experimental quantum physicist.
However, it‚Äôs good to have this basic understanding of quantum physics to really understand how quantum computers work: in some sense that we will make precise, they follow <em>all</em> computational paths at the same time, and give an answer that depends on <em>all</em> of the results.</p>

<p>It is very natural, reading this, to wonder why it is that we don‚Äôt experience quantum effects in our daily lives.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
You can try throwing a ball at a wall with two open windows as much as you want, but you‚Äôll never have it go through both windows simultaneously.
The answer is the very thing that‚Äôs stopping us from being able to actually build quantum computers with our current technology: <strong>decoherence</strong>.

This also ties in with the fact that, given any ‚Äòquantum theorem‚Äô (i.e. formula or equation for a quantum system), if we make all the ‚Äòquantum terms‚Äô tend to zero then we should recover the corresponding ‚Äòclassical theorem‚Äô.
Later on we will talk about decoherence again, and look at what it means explicitly in terms of quantum circuits, but to begin with we just sort of ignore it and work in an ideal world where we can get rid of it entirely.</p>

<h3>Axiomatics</h3>

<p>In our discussion of the double-slit experiment we mentioned how there were ‚Äòextra‚Äô numbers <script type="math/tex">\varphi_i</script> associated to the probabilities <script type="math/tex">p_i</script>, so let‚Äôs try to formalise that now.
Quantum theory suggests that we work with <strong>probability amplitudes</strong> instead of <strong>probabilities</strong>.
That is, rather than just saying an event happens with probability <script type="math/tex">p</script> for some real number <script type="math/tex">0\leqslant p\leqslant1</script>, we say that it has <strong>associated probability amplitude <script type="math/tex">z</script></strong>, where <script type="math/tex">z</script> is some complex number such that <script type="math/tex">\vert z\vert\leqslant1</script>, and then the probability of the event occurring is exactly <script type="math/tex">|z|</script>.
The way that amplitudes behave are very similar to they ways that probabilities behave: the amplitude associated to two events occurring one after the other is the <em>product</em> <script type="math/tex">z_1z_2</script> of their probability amplitudes; the amplitude associated to an event that can occur in two different ways it the sum <script type="math/tex">z_1+z_2</script> of the amplitudes associated to the individual ways.
In fact, writing our complex numbers as <script type="math/tex">z=|z|e^{i\varphi}</script>, we can recover the probability in the double-slit experiment:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">|z_1+z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + z_1^*z_2 + z_1z_2^* = p_1 + p_2 + 2\sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2).</script>

<p>The other generalisation of classical things that we work with is the idea of a <strong>qubit</strong>.
The classical idea of a <strong>bit</strong> is that we can store information by encoding things in binary and then, for example, inducing a charge between the plates of a capacitor to represent a 1, and leaving it uncharged to represent a 0.
To make this quantum, we can look at storing our data not on capacitors but on electrons, or using polarisation of light.
For example, we could say that an electron in its <strong>ground state</strong> (its lowest energy state) represents a 0, and if it‚Äôs in a higher energy state then it represents a 1.
So far so good, but what‚Äôs new?
Well, by shining light of varying frequencies and brightness for varying durations, we can change the electron‚Äôs energy state, but if we shine light at, for example, half the brightness, then we will find that our electron is now in a state that can‚Äôt be described classically: it‚Äôs in a <strong>coherent superposition</strong> of states.
These are states where the electron is in <em>both energy levels at once</em>, similar to how the particle went through both slits at once.</p>

<p>Again, I‚Äôm not really the best person to explain this, but the idea is that, experimentally, we can prepare particles in such a way that, when we measure their energy, sometimes we find that they‚Äôre in their ground state, and other times they‚Äôre in their higher energy state (and anything that we can prepare consistently like this we call a <strong>qubit</strong>; we call one of the states <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and the other <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>
But, you may be saying, how do we know that it isn‚Äôt simply the case that some of the particles we prepare are already in one state, and the others in another state?
That is, imagine the two following scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have an electron in an ‚Äòequal‚Äô superposition (it‚Äôs in both states ‚Äòin equal amounts‚Äô) and we measure its energy</li>
  <li>We have a bag containing two electrons, one in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and the other in state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>. We pick one randomly and measure its energy.</li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases, when we measure the energy of the particle we will find it to be in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> or state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> with equal probability (50%), so how does this supposed ‚Äòsuperposition particle‚Äô differ from a particle with a randomly picked state?
Well, experimentally, we can show a difference, but maybe more convincingly we can give a good mathematical reason why these two situations are completely different.
To do so <em>properly</em>, we need at least the basics of quantum circuitry, but we can describe the proof right now.</p>

<p>If it were the case that sending a pulse of light at the electron that puts it in a 50/50 superposition were the same as simply setting the electron to state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> or <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> randomly, then firing this same beam of light <em>twice</em> in a row at the same electron should be the same as firing it once.
In other words, if we randomly set it to 0 or 1, and then randomly set it <em>again</em> to 0 or 1, it‚Äôs the same as randomly setting it to 0 or 1 just once.
<em>But</em> (and here‚Äôs the kicker), we can show that <em>every single time</em> you start with an electron in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and hit it with this pulse of light two times in a row, what you actually end up with is an electron in state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>.
<em>Every single time.</em>
It‚Äôs a hard thing to understand when you first meet it (and still even after the second and third encounters), but coherent superpositions are not at all the same as a particle being in a randomly chosen state ‚Äì it really is a particle that is in both states at once.</p>

<p>There is a bunch of really exciting ‚Äòquantum philosophy‚Äô that asks questions like, ‚Äúif quantum theory is wrong in some way, then can any of it still be right, or does it all break down if we find one problem?‚Äù, and ‚Äúhow can we tell that there isn‚Äôt a <em>hidden variable</em>?‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúhow do we know that the result of our measurement of a particle isn‚Äôt predetermined?‚Äù.
What is really astonishing is that quantum theory is in some sense more general and powerful that quantum theory.
What do I mean by this?
Well, as an example that I still think about in awe, even if quantum theory is completely entirely ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, in that the universe works by some entirely different theory, then we can <em>still</em> use quantum physics to produce truly random data.
This doesn‚Äôt sound very exciting or big, but if you say it in a different way you can see why people would get so worked up about it: <em>if all of our lab equipment is made by some private corporation that we don‚Äôt trust, and we want to produce a random number, then using quantum physics we can do so with <strong>complete certainty</strong>,<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">5</a></sup> even if the equipment has been tampered with to produce certain states of particles more often than others, or to produce seemingly random states that are actually just following a predetermined order.</em></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to be turning quantum physics into sensationalism now, so this comes with the obvious caveat that doing things in practice is usually really hard.
A quote I remember hearing from Artur is that <em>‚Äúin theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is‚Äù</em>.
But, even so, wow this stuff is cool.</p>

<p>Awed ravings aside,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup> let‚Äôs briefly end this section on axiomatisation by actually stating what our axiomatisation is.
This isn‚Äôt going to be entirely self-contained for those new to maths I‚Äôm afraid ‚Äì I‚Äôm going to freely talk about vector spaces and complex numbers and matrices and the like (basically, <em>linear algebra over <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{C}</script></em>).</p>

<p>The following is all experimentally inspired and guided, but it still a purely <em>mathematical</em> formalism.
So far it seems to agree with every physical experiment we can throw at it, but we won‚Äôt worry too much about this, and instead just see what happens if we play around with the maths, and leave physical implementations to the physicists (though we won‚Äôt forget that, whenever something seems to pop up out of thin air, it‚Äôs almost always because it‚Äôs been suggested to exist by some experimental experiences).</p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>qubit</strong> is any object that can be reliably prepared to be in one of two states (or any superposition therein), manipulated, and measured.
 Any qubit can be described by a <strong>state vector</strong>:<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">7</a></sup> a qubit in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> with probability amplitude <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0</script> and state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> with probability amplitude <script type="math/tex">\alpha_1</script> is represented by the unit vector with entries <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0</script> and <script type="math/tex">\alpha_1</script></p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle \longleftrightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\alpha_0\\\alpha_1\end{pmatrix}.</script>

    <p>This means that the qubit is in an <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\colon\alpha_1</script> coherent superposition, and so when measured it will be in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> with probability <script type="math/tex">\vert\alpha_0\vert^2</script> and in state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> with probability <script type="math/tex">\vert\alpha_1\vert^2</script>.</p>

    <p>Note that we ignore <strong>global phase</strong>: if we have a qubit in the state <script type="math/tex">e^{i\vartheta}(\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle)</script> then this is the same as a qubit in the state <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle</script>.
 We do <strong>not</strong>, however, ignore <strong>local phase</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + e^{i\vartheta}\alpha\vert1\rangle</script> is <strong>not</strong> the same as <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Qubits are modified by <strong>quantum evolutions</strong>: redistributions of the amplitudes between the states (for example, the changes of energy induced by pulses of light on an electron qubit).
 Admissible quantum evolutions are described by complex isometries, in particular by <strong>unitary matrices</strong>.
 For example, the matrix</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

    <p>sends the basis state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> to <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>, and the basis state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> to <script type="math/tex">-\vert0\rangle</script>, and extends linearly to act on any superposition <script type="math/tex">\vert\Psi\rangle = \alpha_0\vert0\rangle + \alpha_1\vert1\rangle</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We take <strong>measurements</strong> corresponding to our choice of basis states <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>.
 As mentioned above, the probability of the outcomes of any measurement are given by the moduli of the probability amplitudes, and the choice of basis consists of distinguishable states, so the outcomes of any measurement are mutually exclusive.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For multiple qubits (and composite systems in general), the corresponding state vectors are the unit vectors in the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces associated to each individual system, e.g. a system consisting of two qubits is described by the complex Hilbert space <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2</script>, and so state vectors are of the form</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}\alpha_0\\\alpha_1\end{pmatrix}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}\beta_0\\\beta_1\end{pmatrix}.</script>

    <p>The evolutions are then described by tensor products of the relevant unitary matrices.</p>

    <p><strong>Edit.</strong> More about this at the end of the post.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>¬†</p>

<p>Finally, for this section, an important note on measurements and the troublesome notion of <strong>collapsing</strong>.
When we have some particle in a coherent superposition and then measure it, we find it in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> with probability <script type="math/tex">\vert\alpha_0\vert</script>.
But then, after the measurement, the particle is in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script>, <em>full stop</em>; there is now no uncertainty, and we know that we can measure this particle over and over and always find it in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script>.
Even more worryingly, the original state <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert0\rangle+\alpha_1\vert1\rangle</script> is completely irretrievable.
This seems to be a contradiction to our assumptions on quantum evolutions: this ‚Äòcollapse‚Äô that follows a measurement is not described by a hermitian operator (in particular, it‚Äôs not invertible, since we lose the original state), but instead something far more blunt and sudden.</p>

<p>There are many ways of dealing with this problem, but the important thing to note is that measurements can still be described in exactly the same way as all other quantum processes, and aren‚Äôt subject to a different axiomatisation or something.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">9</a></sup>
However, for the moment, it‚Äôs a convenient way of thinking that simplifies the maths (and conceptualisation) to just think of measurements as collapses.</p>

<h2>Classical circuits</h2>

<p>Finally for this post, we‚Äôll talk a bit about classical circuits.
Let‚Äôs take a single bit, which can be in one of two states: <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> (off) and <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> (on).
Using the same notation as before, we can use a 2-vector to describe the state of this bit:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix} \,\,\leftrightarrow\, &\vert0\rangle \leftrightarrow \text{off}\\
    \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix} \,\,\leftrightarrow\, &\vert1\rangle \leftrightarrow \text{on}.
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>Then we can describe the four classical computations on a single bit by matrices:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{cccc}
    \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix}\\[1em]
    \text{IDENTITY} & \text{NOT} & \text{CONSTANT-0} & \text{CONSTANT-1}
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>If we have two bits, we can use that <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2\otimes\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{R}^4</script> to write state vectors in the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}\delta_a\\1-\delta_a\end{pmatrix}\otimes \begin{pmatrix}\delta_b\\1-\delta_b\end{pmatrix} \longleftrightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\delta_a\otimes\delta_b\\\delta_a\otimes(1-\delta_b)\\(1-\delta_a)\otimes\delta_b\\(1-\delta_a)\otimes(1-\delta_b)\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>for <script type="math/tex">\delta_a,\delta_b\in\{0,1\}</script>.</p>

<p>Then, for example, a gate that acts as NOT on the first bit and as the CONSTANT1 gate on the second bit would be given by<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">10</a></sup> the matrix</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} \otimes \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&0\\0&0&1&1\\0&0&0&0\\1&1&0&0\end{pmatrix}. %]]></script>

<hr />

<p><strong>Edit.</strong> Somehow I forgot to talk about <strong>entanglement</strong>, so let me fix that now with a small update.</p>

<p>When we have a multi-particle system (e.g. two qubits), then the states of this joint system are described by tensor products, as we said in our four-point axiomatisation.
This means that states of the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert0\rangle\otimes\vert0\rangle = \vert0\rangle\vert0\rangle = \vert00\rangle</script>

<p>(where the latter two equalities are just us introducing some shorthand notation) describe our system.
However, not every element of a tensor product is a tensor of elements in each component: they are <em>linear combinations</em> of such things.
For example,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha\vert00\rangle + \beta\vert01\rangle = \vert0\rangle\otimes(\alpha\vert0\rangle + \beta\vert1\rangle)</script>

<p>but</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha\vert00\rangle + \beta\vert11\rangle</script>

<p><em>cannot</em> be written in the form <script type="math/tex">\vert \Psi_a\rangle\otimes\vert \Psi_b\rangle</script>.</p>

<p>We call states in the former form (tensors of states of the composite systems) <strong>pure states</strong>, and the latter form (states that don‚Äôt ‚Äòsplit‚Äô as a state in each composite system) <strong>entangled states</strong>, because somehow the two systems are interacting with each other in such a way that we can‚Äôt ‚Äòpull them apart‚Äô.</p>

        <p>I am not at all a physicist, and my knowledge of quantum physics in particular comes solely from undergraduate courses that I followed years ago, and any reading I can get done when feeling mathematical but not inclined to work on my thesis.
However, after scanning through some papers by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0512103">Bartlett</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2469">Baez, Lauda</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465">Lurie</a>, my interest in quantum physics, and quantum computing especially, has come back with a vengeance.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p><em>The following is aimed at people who have maybe read some things about quantum physics before and know some linear algebra.</em></p>

<p>Quantum computing has fascinated me ever since  I first studied it at university, despite being a self-proclaimed ‚Äònon-physicist‚Äô, swearing to do only ‚Äòmathematical maths‚Äô and none of this applied stuff (a shameful phase that I am really glad I outgrew).
This is without a doubt almost entirely due to the incredible teaching of <a href="http://www.arturekert.org">Artur Ekert</a>, whose lectures were probably the best that I ever experienced as an undergrad/masters student.
Really, most of what I‚Äôm going to say comes from notes I took in these lectures, so hopefully I don‚Äôt distort them too much.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that I‚Äôm posting this, apart from to help me to not forget it, is that quantum physics has such a strong link to <script type="math/tex">n</script>-category theory, but I don‚Äôt know at all really how quantum computing fits into this <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nPOV">nPOV</a> picture.
As a naive guess, I would think that there is some `string diagram‚Äô approach to all this, but I‚Äôd need to sit down and have a think about what exactly that would be‚Ä¶
So if anybody has any comments or references then I‚Äôd be more that interested to hear them!</p>

<h2>Foundational ideas</h2>

<p>Before jumping in to the jacuzzi that is quantum circuitry, let‚Äôs dip our toes in the vast ocean of <strong>quantum physics axiomatisation</strong>.
First of all though, a note on quantum computers in practice.
There are a bunch of companies that make ‚Äòquantum computers‚Äô (for example the <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com">D-Wave</a>) but these are of a completely different species to those that we‚Äôre going to have a look at.
These computers work using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing">quantum annealing</a> ‚Äì a sort of quantum version of <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Simulated_annealing">thermal annealing</a>; what I‚Äôm going to talk about are <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quantum_Turing_machine">universal quantum computers</a>.
Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the famous quantum algorithms, like Shor‚Äôs, cannot be implemented in this way.Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the more well-known quantum algorithms, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm?oldformat=true">Shor‚Äôs</a>, cannot be implemented in this way.
I hate to be a cynic about something in which I am far from an expert, but it seems to me that calling systems like the D-Wave ‚Äòquantum computers‚Äô is a way to boost sales by using not-entirely-false-but-definitely-misleading buzzwords.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Another very important point is that <strong>quantum algorithm complexity</strong> is by no means trivial.
Said in another way, there are some things that quantum computers can do so much better than classical ones (e.g. prime factorisation), but they are neither ‚Äòbetter‚Äô nor ‚Äòfaster‚Äô overall: there are some things that they are much <em>worse</em> at than classical computers.
Expecting a quantum computer to be able to run arbitrary programs quicker than a classical computer is somewhat akin to expecting an otter to be able to drink a pint of water quicker than a pigeon could, simply because an otter swims faster in water.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Anyway, with that aside, let‚Äôs go get our feet wet.</p>

<h3>Quantum interference</h3>

<p>Here is an experimental fact that you can read about in who-knows-how-many places and find numerous videos of: if we send a particle through a barrier with two tiny (really really tiny) holes (or <em>slits</em>, to agree with the name <strong>double-slit experiment</strong>) and place a detector on the other side, it is <em>not necessarily</em> true that the particle reaches the detector with probability <script type="math/tex">p_1+p_2</script>, where <script type="math/tex">p_i</script> is the probability of the particle going through the <script type="math/tex">i</script>-th hole.
In fact, the probability is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_1 + p_2 + 2\sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\varphi_i</script> are numbers, called the <strong>phase</strong>, associated to the <script type="math/tex">p_i</script> (we describe what exactly they are in a bit).
This means that the total probability depends on the <strong>relative phase</strong> of the system: the value <script type="math/tex">\vert\varphi_1-\varphi_2\vert</script>.
Sometimes this <em>will</em> agree with <script type="math/tex">p_1+p_2</script>, and sometimes <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>The point is, the <strong>Kolmogorov additivity axiom</strong> (the probability of two <em>mutually exclusive</em> events is the sum of the probabilities of the constituent events) seems to fail ‚Äì but why?
As a result of decades of thinking and experiments and failed ideas, the theory that seems the ‚Äòmost likely‚Äô is that of <strong>quantum theory</strong>, which says in particular that <em>the particle passes through both slits simultaneously</em>, and so the events of passing through each slit individually are <em>not</em> mutually exclusive at all.
This does seem to explain the formula for the probability of detection that we described above: the only way that it can depend on <script type="math/tex">\varphi_1-\varphi_2</script> is if the particle ‚Äòinteracts‚Äô with both paths each time it passes through the barrier.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not going to talk much more about actual quantum physics, since there are so many great references written about it already, and I am also not a physicist, and even less so an experimental quantum physicist.
However, it‚Äôs good to have this basic understanding of quantum physics to really understand how quantum computers work: in some sense that we will make precise, they follow <em>all</em> computational paths at the same time, and give an answer that depends on <em>all</em> of the results.</p>

<p>It is very natural, reading this, to wonder why it is that we don‚Äôt experience quantum effects in our daily lives.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
You can try throwing a ball at a wall with two open windows as much as you want, but you‚Äôll never have it go through both windows simultaneously.
The answer is the very thing that‚Äôs stopping us from being able to actually build quantum computers with our current technology: <strong>decoherence</strong>.
Simply put, no physical system is really truly separate from the external environment ‚Äì there is always gravity of far away objects pulling on things, and even being able to <em>look</em> at a physical system means that there are photons passing through and touching things and generally being a nuisance.
Decoherence, then, is when the external environment ‚Äògets in the way‚Äô of our very delicate teeny tiny quantum systems, and influences the <strong>interference term</strong> (the term with the relative phase) in such a way that we can‚Äôt recover it.
This also ties in with the fact that, given any ‚Äòquantum theorem‚Äô (i.e. formula or equation for a quantum system), if we make all the ‚Äòquantum terms‚Äô tend to zero then we should recover the corresponding ‚Äòclassical theorem‚Äô.
Later on we will talk about decoherence again, and look at what it means explicitly in terms of quantum circuits, but to begin with we just sort of ignore it and work in an ideal world where we can get rid of it entirely.</p>

<h3>Axiomatics</h3>

<p>In our discussion of the double-slit experiment we mentioned how there were ‚Äòextra‚Äô numbers <script type="math/tex">\varphi_i</script> associated to the probabilities <script type="math/tex">p_i</script>, so let‚Äôs try to formalise that now.
Quantum theory suggests that we work with <strong>probability amplitudes</strong> instead of <strong>probabilities</strong>.
That is, rather than just saying an event happens with probability <script type="math/tex">p</script> for some real number <script type="math/tex">0\leqslant p\leqslant1</script>, we say that it has <strong>associated probability amplitude <script type="math/tex">z</script></strong>, where <script type="math/tex">z</script> is some complex number such that <script type="math/tex">\vert z\vert\leqslant1</script>, and then the probability of the event occurring is exactly <script type="math/tex">|z|</script>.
The way that amplitudes behave are very similar to they ways that probabilities behave: the amplitude associated to two events occurring one after the other is the <em>product</em> <script type="math/tex">z_1z_2</script> of their probability amplitudes; the amplitude associated to an event that can occur in two different ways it the sum <script type="math/tex">z_1+z_2</script> of the amplitudes associated to the individual ways.
In fact, writing our complex numbers as <script type="math/tex">z=|z|e^{i\varphi}</script>, we can recover the probability in the double-slit experiment:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">|z_1+z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + z_1^*z_2 + z_1z_2^* = p_1 + p_2 + 2\sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2).</script>

<p>The other generalisation of classical things that we work with is the idea of a <strong>qubit</strong>.
The classical idea of a <strong>bit</strong> is that we can store information by encoding things in binary and then, for example, inducing a charge between the plates of a capacitor to represent a 1, and leaving it uncharged to represent a 0.
To make this quantum, we can look at storing our data not on capacitors but on electrons, or using polarisation of light.
For example, we could say that an electron in its <strong>ground state</strong> (its lowest energy state) represents a 0, and if it‚Äôs in a higher energy state then it represents a 1.
So far so good, but what‚Äôs new?
Well, by shining light of varying frequencies and brightness for varying durations, we can change the electron‚Äôs energy state, but if we shine light at, for example, half the brightness, then we will find that our electron is now in a state that can‚Äôt be described classically: it‚Äôs in a <strong>coherent superposition</strong> of states.
These are states where the electron is in <em>both energy levels at once</em>, similar to how the particle went through both slits at once.</p>

<p>Again, I‚Äôm not really the best person to explain this, but the idea is that, experimentally, we can prepare particles in such a way that, when we measure their energy, sometimes we find that they‚Äôre in their ground state, and other times they‚Äôre in their higher energy state (and anything that we can prepare consistently like this we call a <strong>qubit</strong>; we call one of the states <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and the other <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>
But, you may be saying, how do we know that it isn‚Äôt simply the case that some of the particles we prepare are already in one state, and the others in another state?
That is, imagine the two following scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have an electron in an ‚Äòequal‚Äô superposition (it‚Äôs in both states ‚Äòin equal amounts‚Äô) and we measure its energy</li>
  <li>We have a bag containing two electrons, one in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and the other in state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>. We pick one randomly and measure its energy.</li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases, when we measure the energy of the particle we will find it to be in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> or state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> with equal probability (50%), so how does this supposed ‚Äòsuperposition particle‚Äô differ from a particle with a randomly picked state?
Well, experimentally, we can show a difference, but maybe more convincingly we can give a good mathematical reason why these two situations are completely different.
To do so <em>properly</em>, we need at least the basics of quantum circuitry, but we can describe the proof right now.</p>

<p>If it were the case that sending a pulse of light at the electron that puts it in a 50/50 superposition were the same as simply setting the electron to state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> or <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> randomly, then firing this same beam of light <em>twice</em> in a row at the same electron should be the same as firing it once.
In other words, if we randomly set it to 0 or 1, and then randomly set it <em>again</em> to 0 or 1, it‚Äôs the same as randomly setting it to 0 or 1 just once.
<em>But</em> (and here‚Äôs the kicker), we can show that <em>every single time</em> you start with an electron in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and hit it with this pulse of light two times in a row, what you actually end up with is an electron in state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>.
<em>Every single time.</em>
It‚Äôs a hard thing to understand when you first meet it (and still even after the second and third encounters), but coherent superpositions are not at all the same as a particle being in a randomly chosen state ‚Äì it really is a particle that is in both states at once.</p>

<p>There is a bunch of really exciting ‚Äòquantum philosophy‚Äô that asks questions like, ‚Äúif quantum theory is wrong in some way, then can any of it still be right, or does it all break down if we find one problem?‚Äù, and ‚Äúhow can we tell that there isn‚Äôt a <em>hidden variable</em>?‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúhow do we know that the result of our measurement of a particle isn‚Äôt predetermined?‚Äù.
What is really astonishing is that quantum theory is in some sense more general and powerful that quantum theory.
What do I mean by this?
Well, as an example that I still think about in awe, even if quantum theory is completely entirely ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, in that the universe works by some entirely different theory, then we can <em>still</em> use quantum physics to produce truly random data.
This doesn‚Äôt sound very exciting or big, but if you say it in a different way you can see why people would get so worked up about it: <em>if all of our lab equipment is made by some private corporation that we don‚Äôt trust, and we want to produce a random number, then using quantum physics we can do so with <strong>complete certainty</strong>,<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">5</a></sup> even if the equipment has been tampered with to produce certain states of particles more often than others, or to produce seemingly random states that are actually just following a predetermined order.</em></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to be turning quantum physics into sensationalism now, so this comes with the obvious caveat that doing things in practice is usually really hard.
A quote I remember hearing from Artur is that <em>‚Äúin theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is‚Äù</em>.
But, even so, wow this stuff is cool.</p>

<p>Awed ravings aside,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup> let‚Äôs briefly end this section on axiomatisation by actually stating what our axiomatisation is.
This isn‚Äôt going to be entirely self-contained for those new to maths I‚Äôm afraid ‚Äì I‚Äôm going to freely talk about vector spaces and complex numbers and matrices and the like (basically, <em>linear algebra over <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{C}</script></em>).</p>

<p>The following is all experimentally inspired and guided, but it still a purely <em>mathematical</em> formalism.
So far it seems to agree with every physical experiment we can throw at it, but we won‚Äôt worry too much about this, and instead just see what happens if we play around with the maths, and leave physical implementations to the physicists (though we won‚Äôt forget that, whenever something seems to pop up out of thin air, it‚Äôs almost always because it‚Äôs been suggested to exist by some experimental experiences).</p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>qubit</strong> is any object that can be reliably prepared to be in one of two states (or any superposition therein), manipulated, and measured.
 Any qubit can be described by a <strong>state vector</strong>:<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">7</a></sup> a qubit in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> with probability amplitude <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0</script> and state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> with probability amplitude <script type="math/tex">\alpha_1</script> is represented by the unit vector with entries <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0</script> and <script type="math/tex">\alpha_1</script></p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle \longleftrightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\alpha_0\\\alpha_1\end{pmatrix}.</script>

    <p>This means that the qubit is in an <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\colon\alpha_1</script> coherent superposition, and so when measured it will be in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> with probability <script type="math/tex">\vert\alpha_0\vert^2</script> and in state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> with probability <script type="math/tex">\vert\alpha_1\vert^2</script>.</p>

    <p>Note that we ignore <strong>global phase</strong>: if we have a qubit in the state <script type="math/tex">e^{i\vartheta}(\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle)</script> then this is the same as a qubit in the state <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle</script>.
 We do <strong>not</strong>, however, ignore <strong>local phase</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + e^{i\vartheta}\alpha\vert1\rangle</script> is <strong>not</strong> the same as <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert1\rangle + \alpha\vert1\rangle</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Qubits are modified by <strong>quantum evolutions</strong>: redistributions of the amplitudes between the states (for example, the changes of energy induced by pulses of light on an electron qubit).
 Admissible quantum evolutions are described by complex isometries, in particular by <strong>unitary matrices</strong>.
 For example, the matrix</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

    <p>sends the basis state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> to <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>, and the basis state <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> to <script type="math/tex">-\vert0\rangle</script>, and extends linearly to act on any superposition <script type="math/tex">\vert\Psi\rangle = \alpha_0\vert0\rangle + \alpha_1\vert1\rangle</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We take <strong>measurements</strong> corresponding to our choice of basis states <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> and <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script>.
 As mentioned above, the probability of the outcomes of any measurement are given by the moduli of the probability amplitudes, and the choice of basis consists of distinguishable states, so the outcomes of any measurement are mutually exclusive.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For multiple qubits (and composite systems in general), the corresponding state vectors are the unit vectors in the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces associated to each individual system, e.g. a system consisting of two qubits is described by the complex Hilbert space <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2</script>, and so state vectors are of the form</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}\alpha_0\\\alpha_1\end{pmatrix}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}\beta_0\\\beta_1\end{pmatrix}.</script>

    <p>The evolutions are then described by tensor products of the relevant unitary matrices.</p>

    <p><strong>Edit.</strong> More about this at the end of the post.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>¬†</p>

<p>Finally, for this section, an important note on measurements and the troublesome notion of <strong>collapsing</strong>.
When we have some particle in a coherent superposition and then measure it, we find it in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> with probability <script type="math/tex">\vert\alpha_0\vert</script>.
But then, after the measurement, the particle is in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script>, <em>full stop</em>; there is now no uncertainty, and we know that we can measure this particle over and over and always find it in state <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script>.
Even more worryingly, the original state <script type="math/tex">\alpha_0\vert0\rangle+\alpha_1\vert1\rangle</script> is completely irretrievable.
This seems to be a contradiction to our assumptions on quantum evolutions: this ‚Äòcollapse‚Äô that follows a measurement is not described by a hermitian operator (in particular, it‚Äôs not invertible, since we lose the original state), but instead something far more blunt and sudden.</p>

<p>There are many ways of dealing with this problem, but the important thing to note is that measurements can still be described in exactly the same way as all other quantum processes, and aren‚Äôt subject to a different axiomatisation or something.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">9</a></sup>
However, for the moment, it‚Äôs a convenient way of thinking that simplifies the maths (and conceptualisation) to just think of measurements as collapses.</p>

<h2>Classical circuits</h2>

<p>Finally for this post, we‚Äôll talk a bit about classical circuits.
Let‚Äôs take a single bit, which can be in one of two states: <script type="math/tex">\vert0\rangle</script> (off) and <script type="math/tex">\vert1\rangle</script> (on).
Using the same notation as before, we can use a 2-vector to describe the state of this bit:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix} \,\,\leftrightarrow\, &\vert0\rangle \leftrightarrow \text{off}\\
    \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix} \,\,\leftrightarrow\, &\vert1\rangle \leftrightarrow \text{on}.
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>Then we can describe the four classical computations on a single bit by matrices:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{cccc}
    \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix}\\[1em]
    \text{IDENTITY} & \text{NOT} & \text{CONSTANT-0} & \text{CONSTANT-1}
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>If we have two bits, we can use that <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2\otimes\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{R}^4</script> to write state vectors in the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}\delta_a\\1-\delta_a\end{pmatrix}\otimes \begin{pmatrix}\delta_b\\1-\delta_b\end{pmatrix} \longleftrightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\delta_a\otimes\delta_b\\\delta_a\otimes(1-\delta_b)\\(1-\delta_a)\otimes\delta_b\\(1-\delta_a)\otimes(1-\delta_b)\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>for <script type="math/tex">\delta_a,\delta_b\in\{0,1\}</script>.</p>

<p>Then, for example, a gate that acts as NOT on the first bit and as the CONSTANT1 gate on the second bit would be given by<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">10</a></sup> the matrix</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} \otimes \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&0\\0&0&1&1\\0&0&0&0\\1&1&0&0\end{pmatrix}. %]]></script>

<hr />

<p><strong>Edit.</strong> Somehow I forgot to talk about <strong>entanglement</strong>, so let me fix that now with a small update.</p>

<p>When we have a multi-particle system (e.g. two qubits), then the states of this joint system are described by tensor products, as we said in our four-point axiomatisation.
This means that states of the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert0\rangle\otimes\vert0\rangle = \vert0\rangle\vert0\rangle = \vert00\rangle</script>

<p>(where the latter two equalities are just us introducing some shorthand notation) describe our system.
However, not every element of a tensor product is a tensor of elements in each component: they are <em>linear combinations</em> of such things.
For example,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha\vert00\rangle + \beta\vert01\rangle = \vert0\rangle\otimes(\alpha\vert0\rangle + \beta\vert1\rangle)</script>

<p>but</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha\vert00\rangle + \beta\vert11\rangle</script>

<p><em>cannot</em> be written in the form <script type="math/tex">\vert \Psi_a\rangle\otimes\vert \Psi_b\rangle</script>.</p>

<p>We call states in the former form (tensors of states of the composite systems) <strong>pure states</strong>, and the latter form (states that don‚Äôt ‚Äòsplit‚Äô as a state in each composite system) <strong>entangled states</strong>, because somehow the two systems are interacting with each other in such a way that we can‚Äôt ‚Äòpull them apart‚Äô.</p>

Now would be a great time to talk about operads, but I really could not do a better job than [Tai-Danae Bradley](https://twitter.com/math3ma) has already done over at her [blog](http://www.math3ma.com) in the post _What is an Operad_, [part 1](http://www.math3ma.com/mathema/2017/10/23/what-is-an-operad-part-1) and [part 2](http://www.math3ma.com/mathema/2017/10/30/what-is-an-operad-part-2).
So throughout this post I'm going to assume that you've read this, and I'll freely reference bits of it without necessarily saying so.

One of the really important points that Tai-Danae makes is talking about the theorem by May that says that

1. $$1$$-fold loop spaces are (weakly homotopy) equivalent to algebras over the associahedra operad; and
2. $$k$$-fold loop spaces (for $$k\geqslant2$$) are (weakly homotopy) equivalent to algebras over the little $$k$$-cubes operad.

But as well as algebras over an operad, we also have the notion of **spaces** over an operad, where we obtain similar looking equivalences.
This idea is more in the language of **brave new algebra** ‚Äì a phrase introduced by Waldhausen for topological spaces that have some algebraic structures up to coherent homotopies.
There is a paper, _Introduction to Algebra over "Brave New Rings"_, by R.M. Vogt (Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo, Serie II, Suppl. 59 (1999) pp. 49-82) that is a really great read, if you keep in mind the proviso of slightly different approach: he often works with **non-$$\Sigma$$-operads**, which are operads without necessarily having the datum of an action by the symmetric group.
Just to save you from finding his exact definition, I paraphrase it here.

---

**Definition.** A **non-$$\Sigma$$-operad** is a $$\mathsf{Top}$$-enriched category $$\mathcal{A}$$ with objects in bijection with $$\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,\ldots\}$$, along with an associative continuous bifunctor $$\oplus\colon\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}$$ given on objects by $$m\oplus n=m+n$$, and such that, for all $$k$$ and $$n$$, the morphism

    \coprod_{n=\Sigma r_i} \mathcal{A}(r_1,1)\times\ldots\times\mathcal{A}(r_k,1) &\to \mathcal{A}(n,k)\\
    (f_1,\ldots,f_k) &\mapsto f_1\oplus\ldots\oplus f_k
\end{aligned}$$

is a homeomorphism.

There is also the technical assumption that $$\mathrm{id}_1\in\mathcal{A}(1,1)$$ is a closed fibration, which we will pass over.

---

&nbsp;

An important thing to note is how this corresponds to May's definition of an operad.
The property satisfied by $$\oplus$$ on coproducts means that $$\mathcal{A}$$ is actually uniquely determined by composition and the morphism spaces $$\mathcal{A}(n,1)$$ for $$n\geqslant0$$, which is the data that May uses to define (non-$$\Sigma$$-)operads.

The very first page of Vogt's paper has a beautiful 'dictionary' that I'll reproduce (in full, even though we won't talk about some of the more complicated rows) here, as well as adding another column with references to the places where Vogt proves these equivalences.

&nbsp;

Now, first of all, we need to define _what_ exactly e.g. an $$A_\infty$$-space is, which means we need to define two things:

1. the operad $$\mathcal{A}_\infty$$, and
2. the notion of a space over an operad.

For the second point, given some non-$$\Sigma$$-operad $$\mathcal{A}$$, we define an **$$\mathcal{A}$$-space** to be a continuous functor $$X\colon\mathcal{B}\to\mathsf{Top}$$ that sends $$\oplus$$ to $$\times$$.
In particular then, $$X(n)=X(1)^n$$, and so we often abuse notation and identify $$X$$ with the space $$X(1)$$.

For the first point, we let $$\mathrm{Assoc}$$ be the terminal non-$$\Sigma$$-operad, so that each $$\mathrm{Assoc}(n,1)$$ consists of just a single point which we will call {$$\mu_n$$}.
This forces the composition to satisfy

$$\mu_k\circ(\mu_{r_1}\oplus\ldots\oplus\mu_{r_k}) = \mu_{r_1+\ldots+r_k}.$$

It can be seen that an $$\mathrm{Assoc}$$-space is exactly a monoid (this is example 2.4 in Vogt).

---

**Definition.** Let $$\mathcal{B}$$ be a non-$$\Sigma$$-operad.
We say that it is an **$$A_\infty$$-operad** if the unique functor $$\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{A}_\infty$$ is a homotopy equivalence of the underlying morphism spaces.
If this is the case, then we call a $$\mathcal{B}$$-space an **$$A_\infty$$-space**.

---

**Warning.** _What follows is much less even than a sketch of an elephant by a blind man._

Again, there is an important note about names and notation.
What is commonly known as the **associative operad** $$\mathrm{Assoc}$$ is referred to as $$\mathcal{A}$$ in Vogt, and what is now called $$\mathcal{A}_\infty$$ is called $$\mathcal{W}\mathcal{A}$$ in Vogt, because he constructs it as a 'homotopy universal $$A_\infty$$ operad' from taking some free operad and quotienting by certain relations (sections 2.6, 2.7).
In fact, there is the idea of [Boardman-Vogt resolution](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Boardman-Vogt+resolution), which is a specific choice of cofibrant resolution of operads, and the associahedra operad gives such a resolution of $$\mathrm{Assoc}$$, i.e. a cofibrant replacement:

$$\mathcal{A}_\infty\to\mathrm{Assoc}.$$

As for the commutative case, section 3 of Vogt explains in detail how the little cubes operad (in one dimension) is an $$A_\infty$$-operad that acts on loop spaces.
This generalises in section 6 to showing that $$n$$-fold loop spaces can be acted on by the little $$n$$-cubes operad, and taking a suitable colimit we find that infinite loop spaces are acted on by some 'little $$\infty$$-cubes operad'.
That is, we define $$E_n$$ to be the little $$n$$-discs operad[^1], and $$E_\infty$$ to be the colimit of the $$E_n$$, which is weakly equivalent to the commutative operad $$\mathrm{Comm}$$.
As an interesting fact, we can see that $$E_n$$ is generally homotopically non-trivial (tiny picture below), but $$E_\infty$$ is contractible.

![Proof that $$E_2(2)$$ is homotopic to the circle](/assets/post-images/2018-3-12-spectra-part-3-E22.jpg)

I haven't really talked much about spectra here, but the definition of an **infinite loop space** in Vogt is the same as the definition of an $$\Omega$$-spectrum in the previous post.
Vogt mentions (5.2) that if $$X$$ is an infinite loop space then $$Y\mapsto[Y,X_n]^\bullet$$ defines a cohomology theory, and that any cohomology theory arises in this way.
This all seems really nice, but I'm not entirely certain how complicated a proof of this is, or how trivial this statement is.

In particular then, <script type="math/tex">X(n)=X(1)^n</script>, and so we often abuse notation and identify <script type="math/tex">X</script> with the space <script type="math/tex">X(1)</script>.</p>

<p>For the first point, we let <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Assoc}</script> be the terminal non-<script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script>-operad, so that each <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Assoc}(n,1)</script> consists of just a single point which we will call {<script type="math/tex">\mu_n</script>}.
This forces the composition to satisfy</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mu_k\circ(\mu_{r_1}\oplus\ldots\oplus\mu_{r_k}) = \mu_{r_1+\ldots+r_k}.</script>

<p>It can be seen that an <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Assoc}</script>-space is exactly a monoid (this is example 2.4 in Vogt).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script> be a non-<script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script>-operad.
We say that it is an <strong><script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-operad</strong> if the unique functor <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{A}_\infty</script> is a homotopy equivalence of the underlying morphism spaces.
If this is the case, then we call a <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script>-space an <strong><script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-space</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Warning.</strong> <em>What follows is much less even than a sketch of an elephant by a blind man.</em></p>

<p>Again, there is an important note about names and notation.
What is commonly known as the <strong>associative operad</strong> <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Assoc}</script> is referred to as <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> in Vogt, and what is now called <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}_\infty</script> is called <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{W}\mathcal{A}</script> in Vogt, because he constructs it as a ‚Äòhomotopy universal <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script> operad‚Äô from taking some free operad and quotienting by certain relations (sections 2.6, 2.7).
In fact, there is the idea of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Boardman-Vogt+resolution">Boardman-Vogt resolution</a>, which is a specific choice of cofibrant resolution of operads, and the associahedra operad gives such a resolution of <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Assoc}</script>, i.e. a cofibrant replacement:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{A}_\infty\to\mathrm{Assoc}.</script>

<p>As for the commutative case, section 3 of Vogt explains in detail how the little cubes operad (in one dimension) is an <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-operad that acts on loop spaces.
This generalises in section 6 to showing that <script type="math/tex">n</script>-fold loop spaces can be acted on by the little <script type="math/tex">n</script>-cubes operad, and taking a suitable colimit we find that infinite loop spaces are acted on by some ‚Äòlittle <script type="math/tex">\infty</script>-cubes operad‚Äô.
That is, we define <script type="math/tex">E_n</script> to be the little <script type="math/tex">n</script>-discs operad[^1], and <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script> to be the colimit of the <script type="math/tex">E_n</script>, which is weakly equivalent to the commutative operad <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Comm}</script>.
As an interesting fact, we can see that <script type="math/tex">E_n</script> is generally homotopically non-trivial (tiny picture below), but <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script> is contractible.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2018-3-12-spectra-part-3-E22.jpg" alt="Proof that $$E_2(2)$$ is homotopic to the circle" /></p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt really talked much about spectra here, but the definition of an <strong>infinite loop space</strong> in Vogt is the same as the definition of an <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum in the previous post.
Vogt mentions (5.2) that if <script type="math/tex">X</script> is an infinite loop space then <script type="math/tex">Y\mapsto[Y,X_n]^\bullet</script> defines a cohomology theory, and that any cohomology theory arises in this way.
This all seems really nice, but I‚Äôm not entirely certain how complicated a proof of this is, or how trivial this statement is.</p>

TI"Using the idea of weighted limits, defined in the last post, we can now talk about **ends**.
The idea of an end is that, given some functor $$F\colon \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$$, which we can think of as defining both a left and a right action on $$\prod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)$$, we wish to construct some sort of universal subobject[^1] where the two actions coincide.
Dually, a motivation behind the **coend** is in asking for some universal quotient of $$\coprod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)$$ that _forces_ the two actions to agree.

**Edit:** If you actually want to learn this stuff then have a look at either of Emily Riehl's books ([Categorical Homotopy Theory](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/cathtpy.pdf) and [Category Theory in Context](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf)).
I honestly don't think there is a better teaching of this anywhere else in the literature.

## Ends

### Definitions and settings

We can define ends in enriched categories in a pretty slick manner, and in not-necessarily-enriched categories in a still-not-too-messy way.

First, let $$\mathcal{C}$$ and $$\mathcal{D}$$ be $$\mathcal{V}$$-enriched categories (with $$\mathcal{V}$$ a closed symmetric monoidal category) and $$F\colon \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$$ a $$\mathcal{V}$$-functor.
Then the **end** of $$F$$, written $$\int_\mathcal{C} F$$ is (_if it exists!_) the $$\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}$$-weighted limit of $$F$$:

$$\int_{c\in\mathcal{C}} F(c,c) := \mathrm{lim}^{\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}} F.$$

Dually, the **coend** of $$F$$, written $$\int^\mathcal{C} F$$, is

$$\int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} F(c,c) := \mathrm{colim}^{\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}}} F.$$

Alternatively now, suppose that we have some $$F\colon \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$$ between not-necessarily-enriched categories.
We can still define the end by using **wedges**.
A **wedge** $$e\colon w\to F$$ is the data of an object $$e\in\mathcal{D}$$ and morphisms $$e_c\colon w\to F(c,c)$$ such that, for any $$f\colon c\to c'$$, the following diagram commutes:

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
w & \xrightarrow{e_{c'}} & F(c',c')\\
^{e_c}\Big\downarrow\,\,\,\, & & _{F(f,\mathrm{id})}\Big\downarrow\qquad\\
F(c,c) & \xrightarrow{F(\mathrm{id},f)} & F(c,c')
\end{array}$$

Then we can define the end as a _universal_ wedge $$w$$ (if it exists), i.e. any other wedge $$w'$$ factors uniquely through $$w'\to w$$

### Examples

I'm going to talk more about the exciting examples and applications of ends (tensor products of categories, geometric realisation, and Day convolution) in the next post in this series, but I would feel awful if I didn't mention at least a couple here.

One application of ends is in defining **natural transformations**, which shows how overarching the concept is.
It is pretty much a triviality (from the definitions)[^4] that

$$[\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}](F,G) \cong \int_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{D}\big(F(c),G(c)\big).$$

This is a nice way of saying it, because it means that we can get the enriched natural transformations of enriched functors "for free" by defining them in exactly this way.

Another nice example ([from the nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/end#enriched_functor_categories)) is when we take $$\mathcal{V}=\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}\cup\{\infty\}$$, with the monoidal product given by addition.
Then a $$\mathcal{V}$$-enriched category is a metric space, and the hom objects tell us the distance between points.
Further, given two maps $$f,g\colon X\to Y$$ between two metric spaces, the distance between the maps is exactly the enriched functor-category[^5] (given by the end)

$$[X,Y](f,g) = \int _{x\in X} Y(f(x),g(x)) = \sup_{x\in X} Y(f(x),g(x)) = \sup_{x\in X} \|f(x),g(x)\|_Y.$$

Finally, for the moment, there is the example of **Kan extensions**.
If we have some $$\mathcal{V}$$-enriched category $$\mathcal{D}$$ that is tensored[^6] over $$\mathcal{V}$$, and some functors $$F\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$$ and $$p\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{B}$$, then the **left Kan extension** of $$F$$ along $$p$$ is given by the coend:

$$\mathrm{Lan}F = \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathrm{Hom}(p(c),-)\odot F(c)$$

where $$\odot$$ is the co-power.

In particular then, we see that the generalisation of limits to weighted limits is 'at least as general as' the idea of Kan extensions.

## Manipulation and ninja Yoneda

It's often useful to know the following fact: *continuous functors preserve ends (and, dually, cocontinuous functors preserve coends)*.
In particular,

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{D}\left( d,\int_\mathcal{C} F \right) &\cong \int_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{D}(d,F)\\
    \mathcal{D}\left( \int^\mathcal{C}\!\!F, d \right) &\cong \int_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{D}(F,d).
\end{aligned}$$

We can also rephrase the Yoneda lemma[^3] in terms of ends, as well as finding a **co-Yoneda lemma**.[^2]
The Yoneda lemma (in the setting of $$\mathcal{V}$$-enriched categories) reads

$$[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V}](\mathcal{C}(-,c),F) \cong F(c)$$

and so can be rephrased as

$$F \cong \int_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}(c,-)\otimes F(c)$$

whence we find the co-Yoneda lemma:

$$F \cong \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}(-,c)\otimes F(c).$$

# Footnotes

[^1]: A subobject of an object $$y$$ is a class of isomorphisms of monomorphisms into $$y$$.
[^2]: This presentation of the (co-)Yoneda lemma is [sometimes referred to](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20451) as the _ninja Yoneda lemma_.
[^3]: When phrased in terms of ends, this is sometimes called _Yoneda reduction_.
[^4]: One thing that I've learnt whilst reading about category theory, or even just modern maths in general, is that it is very tempting to _accept_ that something is a triviality without really thinking about _why_ it's trivial. Many a time have I thought that I knew that something was trivial only to fail to be able to explain it to somebody when asked. My new year's resolution is to always prove that trivialities are trivial.
[^5]: I'm not sure if this should be 'enriched functor-category' or 'enriched-functor category'. My first thought was the latter, because it's the category of enriched functors, but I suppose that it's clearer that our natural transformations are also enriched if we describe this as 'the functor category enriched over $$\mathcal{V}$$'. But then, I tend to overuse hyphens when there's more than one adjective, just to be extra safe.
[^6]: 'Tensor' is another name for 'co-power', i.e. a $$\mathcal{V}$$-category $$\mathcal{E}$$ is **tensored over $$\mathcal{V}$$** if all pairs of objects $$(x,k)$$, where $$x\in\mathcal{E}$$ and $$k\in\mathcal{V}$$, have a **co-power**: an object $$k\odot x$$ along with a natural isomorphism $$\mathcal{C}(k\odot x, -) \cong \mathcal{V}(k, \mathcal{C}(x,-))$$, where $$\mathcal{V}(-,-)$$ is the internal hom in $$\mathcal{V}$$.;

        <p>Using the idea of weighted limits, defined in the last post, we can now talk about <strong>ends</strong>.
The idea of an end is that, given some functor <script type="math/tex">F\colon \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</script>, which we can think of as defining both a left and a right action on <script type="math/tex">\prod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)</script>, we wish to construct some sort of universal subobject<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> where the two actions coincide.
Dually, a motivation behind the <strong>coend</strong> is in asking for some universal quotient of <script type="math/tex">\coprod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)</script> that <em>forces</em> the two actions to agree.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you actually want to learn this stuff then have a look at either of Emily Riehl‚Äôs books (<a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/cathtpy.pdf">Categorical Homotopy Theory</a> and <a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf">Category Theory in Context</a>).
I honestly don‚Äôt think there is a better teaching of this anywhere else in the literature.</p>

<h2>Ends</h2>

<h3>Definitions and settings</h3>

<p>We can define ends in enriched categories in a pretty slick manner, and in not-necessarily-enriched categories in a still-not-too-messy way.</p>

<p>First, let <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{D}</script> be <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-enriched categories (with <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script> a closed symmetric monoidal category) and <script type="math/tex">F\colon \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</script> a <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-functor.
Then the <strong>end</strong> of <script type="math/tex">F</script>, written <script type="math/tex">\int_\mathcal{C} F</script> is (<em>if it exists!</em>) the <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}</script>-weighted limit of <script type="math/tex">F</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{c\in\mathcal{C}} F(c,c) := \mathrm{lim}^{\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}} F.</script>

<p>Dually, the <strong>coend</strong> of <script type="math/tex">F</script>, written <script type="math/tex">\int^\mathcal{C} F</script>, is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} F(c,c) := \mathrm{colim}^{\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}}} F.</script>

<p>Alternatively now, suppose that we have some <script type="math/tex">F\colon \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</script> between not-necessarily-enriched categories.
We can still define the end by using <strong>wedges</strong>.
A <strong>wedge</strong> <script type="math/tex">e\colon w\to F</script> is the data of an object <script type="math/tex">e\in\mathcal{D}</script> and morphisms <script type="math/tex">e_c\colon w\to F(c,c)</script> such that, for any <script type="math/tex">f\colon c\to c'</script>, the following diagram commutes:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
w & \xrightarrow{e_{c'}} & F(c',c')\\
^{e_c}\Big\downarrow\,\,\,\, & & _{F(f,\mathrm{id})}\Big\downarrow\qquad\\
F(c,c) & \xrightarrow{F(\mathrm{id},f)} & F(c,c')
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>Then we can define the end as a <em>universal</em> wedge <script type="math/tex">w</script> (if it exists), i.e. any other wedge <script type="math/tex">w'</script> factors uniquely through <script type="math/tex">w'\to w</script></p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm going to talk more about the exciting examples and applications of ends (tensor products of categories, geometric realisation, and Day convolution) in the next post in this series, but I would feel awful if I didn‚Äôt mention at least a couple here.</p>

<p>One application of ends is in defining <strong>natural transformations</strong>, which shows how overarching the concept is.
It is pretty much a triviality (from the definitions)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}](F,G) \cong \int_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{D}\big(F(c),G(c)\big).</script>

<p>This is a nice way of saying it, because it means that we can get the enriched natural transformations of enriched functors ‚Äúfor free‚Äù by defining them in exactly this way.</p>

<p>Another nice example (<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/end#enriched_functor_categories">from the nLab</a>) is when we take <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}=\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}\cup\{\infty\}</script>, with the monoidal product given by addition.
Then a <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-enriched category is a metric space, and the hom objects tell us the distance between points.
Further, given two maps <script type="math/tex">f,g\colon X\to Y</script> between two metric spaces, the distance between the maps is exactly the enriched functor-category<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">3</a></sup> (given by the end)</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[X,Y](f,g) = \int _{x\in X} Y(f(x),g(x)) = \sup_{x\in X} Y(f(x),g(x)) = \sup_{x\in X} \|f(x),g(x)\|_Y.</script>

<p>Finally, for the moment, there is the example of <strong>Kan extensions</strong>.
If we have some <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-enriched category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{D}</script> that is tensored<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">4</a></sup> over <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>, and some functors <script type="math/tex">F\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</script> and <script type="math/tex">p\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{B}</script>, then the <strong>left Kan extension</strong> of <script type="math/tex">F</script> along <script type="math/tex">p</script> is given by the coend:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathrm{Lan}F = \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathrm{Hom}(p(c),-)\odot F(c)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\odot</script> is the co-power.</p>

<p>In particular then, we see that the generalisation of limits to weighted limits is ‚Äòat least as general as‚Äô the idea of Kan extensions.</p>

<h2>Manipulation and ninja Yoneda</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs often useful to know the following fact: <em>continuous functors preserve ends (and, dually, cocontinuous functors preserve coends)</em>.
In particular,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{D}\left( d,\int_\mathcal{C} F \right) &\cong \int_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{D}(d,F)\\
    \mathcal{D}\left( \int^\mathcal{C}\!\!F, d \right) &\cong \int_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{D}(F,d).
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>We can also rephrase the Yoneda lemma<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">5</a></sup> in terms of ends, as well as finding a <strong>co-Yoneda lemma</strong>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
The Yoneda lemma (in the setting of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-enriched categories) reads</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V}](\mathcal{C}(-,c),F) \cong F(c)</script>

<p>and so can be rephrased as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F \cong \int_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}(c,-)\otimes F(c)</script>

<p>whence we find the co-Yoneda lemma:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F \cong \int^{c\in\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}(-,c)\otimes F(c).</script>

TI";In the previous post of this series, I talked a bit about basic loop space stuff and how this gave birth to the idea of 'homotopically-associative algebras'. I'm going to detour slightly from what I was going to delve into next and speak about **delooping** for a bit first. Then I'll introduce **spectra** as sort of a generalisation of infinite deloopings. I'll probably leave the stuff about $$E_\infty$$-algebras for another post, but will definitely at least mention about how it ties in to all this stuff.

<!-- more -->

---

As a warning: I am far (oh so very far) from being an expert in this stuff, so it's very possible that there are mistakes. If you spot any then please do give me a shout.

**Edit (21/04/18):** [this paper by Clark Barwick](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~cbarwick/papers/salamanca.pdf) starts off with a really nice explanation of all this spectra/cohomology stuff.

## Delooping

### The basic idea

The basic idea of delooping is exactly what the name suggests: given some object $$A$$, if we can find another object $$B$$ such that $$A\simeq\Omega B$$ then we say that $$B$$ is the **delooping of $$A$$**. We often write $$\mathbb{B}A$$ or $$\mathcal{B}A$$ to mean the delooping, depending on the context ('groupoidal' or 'topological'), though these are, of course, linked.

As an important note, by looking at the homotopy pullback diagram of a delooping, we see that in some sense a delooping is the same as a suspension. We will come back to this later.

### Groupoids and nerves and geometric realisation

If $$A$$ is some topological group then we have (at least) two ways of describing it:

1. 'topological': we can study principal $$A$$-bundles, and then we have a classifying space $$\mathcal{B}A\in\mathsf{Top}$$;
2. 'groupoidal': we can consider $$A$$ as the one-object groupoid $$\mathbb{B}A\in\infty\mathsf{Grpd}$$ whose morphisms are given by $$A$$.

As the choice of notation suggests, these two 'associated objects' are (we claim) both deloopings of $$A$$ in the relevant category, and, in fact, under the [homotopy hypothesis](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+hypothesis), these two are equivalent via geometric realisation (of the nerve):[^4]

$$\vert N(\mathbb{B}A)\vert\simeq\mathcal{B}A.$$

This is all closely linked to the [bar construction](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bar+construction), but I'm still trying to get my head around the 'good' order in which to understand these things, so maybe I'll come back to this point in a future post.[^1]

Before going any further, we are actually going to look at a concrete example (something that I often forget to do when working in this more abstract setting).

### An example

Let $$A$$ be some group, _which we think of as a discrete groupoid_, and define $$\mathbb{B}A$$ to be the one-object groupoid with morphisms given by $$A$$, as above. We're going to show that this really _is_ a delooping of $$A$$, in that the homotopy square below homotopy-commutes and is homotopy-universal:

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
A &\to &*\\
\downarrow & &\downarrow\\
* &\to &\mathbb{B}A\tag{1}
\end{array}$$

Now the map $$A\to *\to\mathbb{B}A$$ is the constant functor $$\Lambda$$ to the single object of $$\mathbb{B}A$$, and there is a natural transformation $$\eta$$ from this functor to itself given by the identity. Let's unwrap what that says.

First of all, since $$A$$ is a discrete groupoid, the only morphisms are of the form $$\mathrm{id}\colon x\to x$$, so any natural transformation $$\eta\colon\Lambda\implies\Lambda$$ is composed of morphisms $$\eta_x\colon\Lambda(x)\to\Lambda(x)$$, for all $$x\in A$$, such that

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
\Lambda(x) &\xrightarrow{\Lambda(\mathrm{id})} &\Lambda(x)\\
\eta_x\downarrow & &\eta_x\downarrow\\
\Lambda(x) &\xrightarrow{\Lambda(\mathrm{id})} &\Lambda(x)
\end{array}$$

commutes. But by the definition of $$\Lambda$$, this just means that $$\eta_x$$ is any morphism in $$\mathbb{B}A$$, so we can pick the morphism $$x$$ (we're really just using that $$\mathrm{Ob}(A)=\mathrm{Mor}(\mathbb{B}A)$$).

Now we see that $$\eta$$ (defined by the identity) is, as one would hope, a natural isomorphism, which tells us that the square (1) commutes up to homotopy.[^2]

As for showing universality, we cheat:[^3] if we have some other $$A'$$ with a natural isomorphism $$\eta'\colon\Lambda\implies\Lambda$$ then it must map objects in $$A'$$ to isomorphisms (i.e. morphisms) in $$\mathbb{B}A$$. But say that it maps an object $$x'$$ in $$A'$$ to the morphism $$x$$ in $$\mathbb{B}A$$. Then we can factor through $$A$$ by sending the object $$x'$$ in $$A'$$ to the object $$x$$ in $$A$$.

### Infinite delooping

What we showed above is really that every _group_ has a delooping (at least, in the groupoidal sense). A natural question to pose now is, _can we always deloop things_? There is a theorem that states that, when working in the $$(\infty,1)$$-category of topological spaces, we can deloop a space whenever it is an $$A_\infty$$-space, and thus homotopy equivalent to loop space (in the classical sense).

As I'll 'explain' in a bit, if our category is a stable $$(\infty,1)$$-category then all deloopings exist and are given by suspension. Before I do this though, I'm going to give one important example of objects that are **infinitely-deloopable**, i.e. their deloopings can be delooped, and so can _their_ deloopings, and etc., so we have an infinite sequence of objects

$$A, \mathbb{B}A, \mathbb{B}^2A, \ldots.$$

### Singular cohomology and the associated infinite delooping

I claim that any _abelian_ group can be infinitely delooped by setting $$\mathbb{B}^nA$$ to be the ([strict omega](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strict+omega-groupoid)) groupoid that has one object; only identity $$k$$-morphisms for $$k\neq n$$; and $$\mathrm{Mor}_n(\mathbb{B}^nA)=A$$. So we just take our usual construction of $$\mathbb{B}A$$ and 'shift the morphisms up in degree'.

Again, under the homotopy hypothesis, this sequence of deloopings maps to the sequence of [Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eilenberg-Mac+Lane+space):

$$\vert \mathbb{B}^nA\vert \simeq K(A,n).$$

This sequence 'is' (under the identification of connective spectra and strict abelian infinity-groups) the [Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eilenberg-Mac+Lane+spectrum), whatever that might mean (considering that I've yet to even define spectra). Now comes the magic bit.

Let $$X$$ be a pointed topological space[^13] and $$A$$ an abelian group. It is a classical fact[^5] that the group $$H^n(X,A)$$ can be identified with $$\pi_0\mathsf{Top}_*(X,K(A,n))$$, and so the fact that $$\vert\mathbb{B}^nA\vert \simeq K(A,n)$$ tells us that we could just as well _define_ singular cohomology as

$$H^n(X,A) := \pi_0\mathbb{H}(X,\mathbb{B}^nA)$$

where $$\mathbb{H}$$ is some 'nice' category in which we have infinite deloopings of $$A$$, e.g. $$\mathsf{Top}_*$$ or $$\infty\mathsf{Groupoid}$$. Even better, these two example choices of $$\mathbb{H}$$ give us homotopically equivalent objects, by the homotopy hypothesis.

This is really nice for many reasons, but one particularly nice one is that singular cohomology with coefficients in $$A$$ is _representable_, and it is pretty much represented exactly by $$A$$. There is a [theorem](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Brown+representability+theorem) that tells us that, in particular, any sufficiently well-behaved cohomology theory is representable in this way.

## Spectra

So with all this talk around spectra, it's time to actually define them. Like many concepts, there are a bunch of different models and settings, and we're not going to explore most of them, but instead focus on **sequential pre-spectra** and **$$\Omega$$-spectra**.

### The setting (infinity categories)

First of all we work in $$\mathsf{Top}_*$$ and keep our example of $$K(A,n)$$ in mind. Here, we define a **sequential pre-spectrum $$\mathcal{E}$$** to be a sequence $$(\mathcal{E}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$$ of pointed spaces, along with the data of **structure maps**, which are continuous maps $$\Sigma \mathcal{E}_n\to \mathcal{E}_{n+1}$$. Then, using the adjunction $$(\Sigma\dashv\Omega)$$, we can turn these structure maps into maps $$\mathcal{E}_n\to\Omega \mathcal{E}_{n+1}$$. If these are isomorphisms[^6] then we say that $$\mathcal{E}$$ is an **$$\Omega$$-spectrum**.

Our previous example of $$\mathcal{E}_n=K(A,n)$$ then gives us an $$\Omega$$-spectrum. And we see that spectra can be viewed as a generalisation of infinitely-deloopable objects.

In the bigger picture, every sequential pre-spectrum has a **spectrification**, which is an equivalent $$\Omega$$-spectrum given by a [certain filtered colimit](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spectrum#OmegaSpectrum), and these $$\Omega$$-spectra are exactly the fibrant replacements in some model structure.

Generally, we can define [$$\Omega$$-spectrum objects in any $$(\infty,1)$$-category](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spectrum+object#via_spectrum_objects), but when people talk about 'spectra' with no reference to a specific category, it's usually implicit that they are working in $$\mathsf{Top}_*$$ with weak homotopy equivalences.

But the 'honest' setting for spectra is in a **stable $$(\infty,1)$$-category**: pointed[^7] $$(\infty,1)$$-categories $$\mathcal{C}$$ with finite limits, where the loop $$(\infty,1)$$-functor $$\Omega\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}$$ is an _equivalence_, with the inverse given by suspension $$\Sigma$$. Given some not-necessarily-stable pointed $$(\infty,1)$$-category $$\mathcal{C}$$ with finite limits, we can form its **stabilisation** by taking the limit[^8] of iterating the loop space functor on the category of **pointed objects of $$\mathcal{C}$$**:

$$\mathsf{Stab}(\mathcal{C}) := \lim_{\leftarrow}\big(\ldots\to(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\Omega}(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\Omega}(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\big).$$

The prototypical example of such a category is exactly what we've been looking at: _$$\mathsf{Stab}(\mathsf{Top})$$ is the category of $$\Omega$$-spectra in $$\mathsf{Top}_*$$_. In general, we can construct $$\mathsf{Stab}(\mathcal{C})$$ [exactly by taking the category of spectrum objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608228) in $$(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})$$.

A really good introduction to all of this, and where I actually saw most of this for the first time, is [Moritz Groth's _A short course on $$\infty$$-categories_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2925).

This is all understood much better when we bring operads into the picture. In the next post in this series I'll try to show how certain spectra are 'just commutative monoids', and that commutative monoids in an $$(\infty,1)$$-category are 'just $$E_\infty$$-algebras'.

### Nice properties

Before wrapping this post up, I'm just going to mention briefly something that always confused me about spectra that represent cohomology theories.

We can define 'cohomology' in any $$(\infty,1)$$-category $$\mathbb{H}$$ by just setting $$H(X,A):=\pi_0\mathbb{H}(X,A)$$, but if we want this to behave like 'usual' cohomology then we have to impose some restrictions. First of all, if we want our 'cocycles' to classify something (namely principal bundles over $$X$$) then we have to be working in an _$$(\infty,1)$$-topos_. Secondly, if we want to obtain a $$\mathbb{Z}$$-graded cohomology then the simplest way[^10] of doing so is to ask that our coefficient object $$A$$ be a _component of a spectrum object_, i.e. $$A=\mathcal{E}_n$$ for some spectrum object $$\mathcal{E}$$. Thirdly, if we want our cohomology to have a group structure then we need[^11] $$A$$ to be a _group object_, which is always the case if $$A$$ is a component of a spectrum object.[^12] Note that this is abelian if $$A$$ is at least an $$E_2$$-object. Finally, if we want a ring structure then we can ask that the spectrum object $$\mathcal{E}$$ of which $$A$$ is a component be an $$E_\infty$$-ring, or a _ring spectra_.

The point here is that, cohomology can be defined very generally, but if we want to recover something that we really recognise from it then we can basically restrict ourselves to looking at **ring spectra in an $$(\infty,1)$$-topos**.

## That 'classical fact'

A full and good proof (of the fact in question but also much more besides) can be found in Chapter 4.3 of [Hatcher's _Algebraic Topology_](https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf). I'll be content here to give a small sketch, as found in e.g. [these lecture notes](http://math.mit.edu/~mbehrens/18.906/notes/lec15.pdf).

By the universal coefficient theorem, there is a short exact sequence

$$0\to \mathrm{Ext}^1_\mathbb{Z}(H_{n-1}(K(A,n),A)) \to H^n(K(A,n),A) \to \mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(H_n(K(A,n),A),A) \to0.$$

Then, by the [Hurewicz theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurewicz_theorem), we have an isomorphism

$$H^n(K(A,n),A)\xrightarrow{\sim}\mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(A,A).$$

Now take the class of $$\mathrm{id}_A$$ in $$\mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(A,A)$$ and look at its image $$[\iota_n]$$ in $$H^n(K(A,n),A)$$. This gives us a natural (in $$X$$) transformation

$$\begin{aligned}
\eta_X\colon\pi_0\mathsf{Top}_*(X,K(A,n))&\to H^n(X,A)\\
[\gamma]&\mapsto \gamma^*([\iota_n])
\end{aligned}$$

and we claim that it is a natural isomorphism when we restrict to the subcategory of pointed CW complexes.

**Edit:** This 'classical fact' is really a key example of the so-called [Eckmann-Hilton duality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eckmann-Hilton+duality).

I‚Äôm going to detour slightly from what I was going to delve into next and speak about <strong>delooping</strong> for a bit first. Then I‚Äôll introduce <strong>spectra</strong> as sort of a generalisation of infinite deloopings. I‚Äôll probably leave the stuff about <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-algebras for another post, but will definitely at least mention about how it ties in to all this stuff.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>As a warning: I am far (oh so very far) from being an expert in this stuff, so it‚Äôs very possible that there are mistakes. If you spot any then please do give me a shout.</p>

<p><strong>Edit (21/04/18):</strong> <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~cbarwick/papers/salamanca.pdf">this paper by Clark Barwick</a> starts off with a really nice explanation of all this spectra/cohomology stuff.</p>

<h2>Delooping</h2>

<h3>The basic idea</h3>

<p>The basic idea of delooping is exactly what the name suggests: given some object <script type="math/tex">A</script>, if we can find another object <script type="math/tex">B</script> such that <script type="math/tex">A\simeq\Omega B</script> then we say that <script type="math/tex">B</script> is the <strong>delooping of <script type="math/tex">A</script></strong>. We often write <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script> or <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}A</script> to mean the delooping, depending on the context (‚Äògroupoidal‚Äô or ‚Äòtopological‚Äô), though these are, of course, linked.</p>

<p>As an important note, by looking at the homotopy pullback diagram of a delooping, we see that in some sense a delooping is the same as a suspension. We will come back to this later.</p>

<h3>Groupoids and nerves and geometric realisation</h3>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">A</script> is some topological group then we have (at least) two ways of describing it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‚Äòtopological‚Äô: we can study principal <script type="math/tex">A</script>-bundles, and then we have a classifying space <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}A\in\mathsf{Top}</script>;</li>
  <li>‚Äògroupoidal‚Äô: we can consider <script type="math/tex">A</script> as the one-object groupoid <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A\in\infty\mathsf{Grpd}</script> whose morphisms are given by <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As the choice of notation suggests, these two ‚Äòassociated objects‚Äô are (we claim) both deloopings of <script type="math/tex">A</script> in the relevant category, and, in fact, under the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+hypothesis">homotopy hypothesis</a>, these two are equivalent via geometric realisation (of the nerve):<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert N(\mathbb{B}A)\vert\simeq\mathcal{B}A.</script>

<p>This is all closely linked to the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bar+construction">bar construction</a>, but I‚Äôm still trying to get my head around the ‚Äògood‚Äô order in which to understand these things, so maybe I‚Äôll come back to this point in a future post.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Before going any further, we are actually going to look at a concrete example (something that I often forget to do when working in this more abstract setting).</p>

<h3>An example</h3>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">A</script> be some group, <em>which we think of as a discrete groupoid</em>, and define <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script> to be the one-object groupoid with morphisms given by <script type="math/tex">A</script>, as above. We‚Äôre going to show that this really <em>is</em> a delooping of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, in that the homotopy square below homotopy-commutes and is homotopy-universal:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
A &\to &*\\
\downarrow & &\downarrow\\
* &\to &\mathbb{B}A\tag{1}
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>Now the map <script type="math/tex">A\to *\to\mathbb{B}A</script> is the constant functor <script type="math/tex">\Lambda</script> to the single object of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>, and there is a natural transformation <script type="math/tex">\eta</script> from this functor to itself given by the identity. Let‚Äôs unwrap what that says.</p>

<p>First of all, since <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a discrete groupoid, the only morphisms are of the form <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{id}\colon x\to x</script>, so any natural transformation <script type="math/tex">\eta\colon\Lambda\implies\Lambda</script> is composed of morphisms <script type="math/tex">\eta_x\colon\Lambda(x)\to\Lambda(x)</script>, for all <script type="math/tex">x\in A</script>, such that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\Lambda(x) &\xrightarrow{\Lambda(\mathrm{id})} &\Lambda(x)\\
\eta_x\downarrow & &\eta_x\downarrow\\
\Lambda(x) &\xrightarrow{\Lambda(\mathrm{id})} &\Lambda(x)
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>commutes. But by the definition of <script type="math/tex">\Lambda</script>, this just means that <script type="math/tex">\eta_x</script> is any morphism in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>, so we can pick the morphism <script type="math/tex">x</script> (we‚Äôre really just using that <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Ob}(A)=\mathrm{Mor}(\mathbb{B}A)</script>).</p>

<p>Now we see that <script type="math/tex">\eta</script> (defined by the identity) is, as one would hope, a natural isomorphism, which tells us that the square (1) commutes up to homotopy.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As for showing universality, we cheat:<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup> if we have some other <script type="math/tex">A'</script> with a natural isomorphism <script type="math/tex">\eta'\colon\Lambda\implies\Lambda</script> then it must map objects in <script type="math/tex">A'</script> to isomorphisms (i.e. morphisms) in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>. But say that it maps an object <script type="math/tex">x'</script> in <script type="math/tex">A'</script> to the morphism <script type="math/tex">x</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>. Then we can factor through <script type="math/tex">A</script> by sending the object <script type="math/tex">x'</script> in <script type="math/tex">A'</script> to the object <script type="math/tex">x</script> in <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</p>

<h3>Infinite delooping</h3>

<p>What we showed above is really that every <em>group</em> has a delooping (at least, in the groupoidal sense). A natural question to pose now is, <em>can we always deloop things</em>? There is a theorem that states that, when working in the <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category of topological spaces, we can deloop a space whenever it is an <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-space, and thus homotopy equivalent to loop space (in the classical sense).</p>

<p>As I‚Äôll ‚Äòexplain‚Äô in a bit, if our category is a stable <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category then all deloopings exist and are given by suspension. Before I do this though, I‚Äôm going to give one important example of objects that are <strong>infinitely-deloopable</strong>, i.e. their deloopings can be delooped, and so can <em>their</em> deloopings, and etc., so we have an infinite sequence of objects</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A, \mathbb{B}A, \mathbb{B}^2A, \ldots.</script>

<h3>Singular cohomology and the associated infinite delooping</h3>

<p>I claim that any <em>abelian</em> group can be infinitely delooped by setting <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}^nA</script> to be the (<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strict+omega-groupoid">strict omega</a>) groupoid that has one object; only identity <script type="math/tex">k</script>-morphisms for <script type="math/tex">k\neq n</script>; and <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Mor}_n(\mathbb{B}^nA)=A</script>. So we just take our usual construction of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script> and ‚Äòshift the morphisms up in degree‚Äô.</p>

<p>Again, under the homotopy hypothesis, this sequence of deloopings maps to the sequence of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eilenberg-Mac+Lane+space">Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces</a>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert \mathbb{B}^nA\vert \simeq K(A,n).</script>

<p>This sequence ‚Äòis‚Äô (under the identification of connective spectra and strict abelian infinity-groups) the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eilenberg-Mac+Lane+spectrum">Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum</a>, whatever that might mean (considering that I‚Äôve yet to even define spectra). Now comes the magic bit.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">X</script> be a pointed topological space<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and <script type="math/tex">A</script> an abelian group. It is a classical fact<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup> that the group <script type="math/tex">H^n(X,A)</script> can be identified with <script type="math/tex">\pi_0\mathsf{Top}_*(X,K(A,n))</script>, and so the fact that <script type="math/tex">\vert\mathbb{B}^nA\vert \simeq K(A,n)</script> tells us that we could just as well <em>define</em> singular cohomology as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">H^n(X,A) := \pi_0\mathbb{H}(X,\mathbb{B}^nA)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{H}</script> is some ‚Äònice‚Äô category in which we have infinite deloopings of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, e.g. <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> or <script type="math/tex">\infty\mathsf{Groupoid}</script>. Even better, these two example choices of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{H}</script> give us homotopically equivalent objects, by the homotopy hypothesis.</p>

<p>This is really nice for many reasons, but one particularly nice one is that singular cohomology with coefficients in <script type="math/tex">A</script> is <em>representable</em>, and it is pretty much represented exactly by <script type="math/tex">A</script>. There is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Brown+representability+theorem">theorem</a> that tells us that, in particular, any sufficiently well-behaved cohomology theory is representable in this way.</p>

<h2>Spectra</h2>

<p>So with all this talk around spectra, it‚Äôs time to actually define them. Like many concepts, there are a bunch of different models and settings, and we‚Äôre not going to explore most of them, but instead focus on <strong>sequential pre-spectra</strong> and <strong><script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectra</strong>.</p>

<h3>The setting (infinity categories)</h3>

<p>First of all we work in <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> and keep our example of <script type="math/tex">K(A,n)</script> in mind. Here, we define a <strong>sequential pre-spectrum <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script></strong> to be a sequence <script type="math/tex">(\mathcal{E}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</script> of pointed spaces, along with the data of <strong>structure maps</strong>, which are continuous maps <script type="math/tex">\Sigma \mathcal{E}_n\to \mathcal{E}_{n+1}</script>. Then, using the adjunction <script type="math/tex">(\Sigma\dashv\Omega)</script>, we can turn these structure maps into maps <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}_n\to\Omega \mathcal{E}_{n+1}</script>. If these are isomorphisms<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">7</a></sup> then we say that <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script> is an <strong><script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum</strong>.</p>

<p>Our previous example of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}_n=K(A,n)</script> then gives us an <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum. And we see that spectra can be viewed as a generalisation of infinitely-deloopable objects.</p>

<p>In the bigger picture, every sequential pre-spectrum has a <strong>spectrification</strong>, which is an equivalent <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum given by a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spectrum#OmegaSpectrum">certain filtered colimit</a>, and these <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectra are exactly the fibrant replacements in some model structure.</p>

<p>Generally, we can define <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spectrum+object#via_spectrum_objects"><script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum objects in any <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category</a>, but when people talk about ‚Äòspectra‚Äô with no reference to a specific category, it‚Äôs usually implicit that they are working in <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> with weak homotopy equivalences.</p>

<p>But the ‚Äòhonest‚Äô setting for spectra is in a <strong>stable <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category</strong>: pointed<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">8</a></sup> <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-categories <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> with finite limits, where the loop <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-functor <script type="math/tex">\Omega\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}</script> is an <em>equivalence</em>, with the inverse given by suspension <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script>. Given some not-necessarily-stable pointed <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> with finite limits, we can form its <strong>stabilisation</strong> by taking the limit<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">9</a></sup> of iterating the loop space functor on the category of <strong>pointed objects of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script></strong>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Stab}(\mathcal{C}) := \lim_{\leftarrow}\big(\ldots\to(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\Omega}(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\Omega}(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\big).</script>

<p>The prototypical example of such a category is exactly what we‚Äôve been looking at: <em><script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Stab}(\mathsf{Top})</script> is the category of <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectra in <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script></em>.

<h3>Nice properties</h3>

<p>Before wrapping this post up, I‚Äôm just going to mention briefly something that always confused me about spectra that represent cohomology theories.</p>

<p>We can define ‚Äòcohomology‚Äô in any <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{H}</script> by just setting <script type="math/tex">H(X,A):=\pi_0\mathbb{H}(X,A)</script>, but if we want this to behave like ‚Äòusual‚Äô cohomology then we have to impose some restrictions.

        <p>In the previous post of this series, I talked a bit about basic loop space stuff and how this gave birth to the idea of ‚Äòhomotopically-associative algebras‚Äô. I‚Äôm going to detour slightly from what I was going to delve into next and speak about <strong>delooping</strong> for a bit first. Then I‚Äôll introduce <strong>spectra</strong> as sort of a generalisation of infinite deloopings. I‚Äôll probably leave the stuff about <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-algebras for another post, but will definitely at least mention about how it ties in to all this stuff.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>As a warning: I am far (oh so very far) from being an expert in this stuff, so it‚Äôs very possible that there are mistakes. If you spot any then please do give me a shout.</p>

<p><strong>Edit (21/04/18):</strong> <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~cbarwick/papers/salamanca.pdf">this paper by Clark Barwick</a> starts off with a really nice explanation of all this spectra/cohomology stuff.</p>

<h2>Delooping</h2>

<h3>The basic idea</h3>

<p>The basic idea of delooping is exactly what the name suggests: given some object <script type="math/tex">A</script>, if we can find another object <script type="math/tex">B</script> such that <script type="math/tex">A\simeq\Omega B</script> then we say that <script type="math/tex">B</script> is the <strong>delooping of <script type="math/tex">A</script></strong>. We often write <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script> or <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}A</script> to mean the delooping, depending on the context (‚Äògroupoidal‚Äô or ‚Äòtopological‚Äô), though these are, of course, linked.</p>

<p>As an important note, by looking at the homotopy pullback diagram of a delooping, we see that in some sense a delooping is the same as a suspension. We will come back to this later.</p>

<h3>Groupoids and nerves and geometric realisation</h3>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">A</script> is some topological group then we have (at least) two ways of describing it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‚Äòtopological‚Äô: we can study principal <script type="math/tex">A</script>-bundles, and then we have a classifying space <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}A\in\mathsf{Top}</script>;</li>
  <li>‚Äògroupoidal‚Äô: we can consider <script type="math/tex">A</script> as the one-object groupoid <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A\in\infty\mathsf{Grpd}</script> whose morphisms are given by <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As the choice of notation suggests, these two ‚Äòassociated objects‚Äô are (we claim) both deloopings of <script type="math/tex">A</script> in the relevant category, and, in fact, under the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+hypothesis">homotopy hypothesis</a>, these two are equivalent via geometric realisation (of the nerve):<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert N(\mathbb{B}A)\vert\simeq\mathcal{B}A.</script>

<p>This is all closely linked to the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bar+construction">bar construction</a>, but I‚Äôm still trying to get my head around the ‚Äògood‚Äô order in which to understand these things, so maybe I‚Äôll come back to this point in a future post.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Before going any further, we are actually going to look at a concrete example (something that I often forget to do when working in this more abstract setting).</p>

<h3>An example</h3>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">A</script> be some group, <em>which we think of as a discrete groupoid</em>, and define <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script> to be the one-object groupoid with morphisms given by <script type="math/tex">A</script>, as above. We‚Äôre going to show that this really <em>is</em> a delooping of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, in that the homotopy square below homotopy-commutes and is homotopy-universal:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
A &\to &*\\
\downarrow & &\downarrow\\
* &\to &\mathbb{B}A\tag{1}
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>Now the map <script type="math/tex">A\to *\to\mathbb{B}A</script> is the constant functor <script type="math/tex">\Lambda</script> to the single object of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>, and there is a natural transformation <script type="math/tex">\eta</script> from this functor to itself given by the identity. Let‚Äôs unwrap what that says.</p>

<p>First of all, since <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a discrete groupoid, the only morphisms are of the form <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{id}\colon x\to x</script>, so any natural transformation <script type="math/tex">\eta\colon\Lambda\implies\Lambda</script> is composed of morphisms <script type="math/tex">\eta_x\colon\Lambda(x)\to\Lambda(x)</script>, for all <script type="math/tex">x\in A</script>, such that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\Lambda(x) &\xrightarrow{\Lambda(\mathrm{id})} &\Lambda(x)\\
\eta_x\downarrow & &\eta_x\downarrow\\
\Lambda(x) &\xrightarrow{\Lambda(\mathrm{id})} &\Lambda(x)
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>commutes. But by the definition of <script type="math/tex">\Lambda</script>, this just means that <script type="math/tex">\eta_x</script> is any morphism in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>, so we can pick the morphism <script type="math/tex">x</script> (we‚Äôre really just using that <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Ob}(A)=\mathrm{Mor}(\mathbb{B}A)</script>).</p>

<p>Now we see that <script type="math/tex">\eta</script> (defined by the identity) is, as one would hope, a natural isomorphism, which tells us that the square (1) commutes up to homotopy.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As for showing universality, we cheat:<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup> if we have some other <script type="math/tex">A'</script> with a natural isomorphism <script type="math/tex">\eta'\colon\Lambda\implies\Lambda</script> then it must map objects in <script type="math/tex">A'</script> to isomorphisms (i.e. morphisms) in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>. But say that it maps an object <script type="math/tex">x'</script> in <script type="math/tex">A'</script> to the morphism <script type="math/tex">x</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script>. Then we can factor through <script type="math/tex">A</script> by sending the object <script type="math/tex">x'</script> in <script type="math/tex">A'</script> to the object <script type="math/tex">x</script> in <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</p>

<h3>Infinite delooping</h3>

<p>What we showed above is really that every <em>group</em> has a delooping (at least, in the groupoidal sense). A natural question to pose now is, <em>can we always deloop things</em>? There is a theorem that states that, when working in the <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category of topological spaces, we can deloop a space whenever it is an <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-space, and thus homotopy equivalent to loop space (in the classical sense).</p>

<p>As I‚Äôll ‚Äòexplain‚Äô in a bit, if our category is a stable <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category then all deloopings exist and are given by suspension. Before I do this though, I‚Äôm going to give one important example of objects that are <strong>infinitely-deloopable</strong>, i.e. their deloopings can be delooped, and so can <em>their</em> deloopings, and etc., so we have an infinite sequence of objects</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A, \mathbb{B}A, \mathbb{B}^2A, \ldots.</script>

<h3>Singular cohomology and the associated infinite delooping</h3>

<p>I claim that any <em>abelian</em> group can be infinitely delooped by setting <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}^nA</script> to be the (<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strict+omega-groupoid">strict omega</a>) groupoid that has one object; only identity <script type="math/tex">k</script>-morphisms for <script type="math/tex">k\neq n</script>; and <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Mor}_n(\mathbb{B}^nA)=A</script>. So we just take our usual construction of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}A</script> and ‚Äòshift the morphisms up in degree‚Äô.</p>

<p>Again, under the homotopy hypothesis, this sequence of deloopings maps to the sequence of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eilenberg-Mac+Lane+space">Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces</a>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert \mathbb{B}^nA\vert \simeq K(A,n).</script>

<p>This sequence ‚Äòis‚Äô (under the identification of connective spectra and strict abelian infinity-groups) the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eilenberg-Mac+Lane+spectrum">Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum</a>, whatever that might mean (considering that I‚Äôve yet to even define spectra). Now comes the magic bit.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">X</script> be a pointed topological space<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and <script type="math/tex">A</script> an abelian group. It is a classical fact<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup> that the group <script type="math/tex">H^n(X,A)</script> can be identified with <script type="math/tex">\pi_0\mathsf{Top}_*(X,K(A,n))</script>, and so the fact that <script type="math/tex">\vert\mathbb{B}^nA\vert \simeq K(A,n)</script> tells us that we could just as well <em>define</em> singular cohomology as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">H^n(X,A) := \pi_0\mathbb{H}(X,\mathbb{B}^nA)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{H}</script> is some ‚Äònice‚Äô category in which we have infinite deloopings of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, e.g. <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> or <script type="math/tex">\infty\mathsf{Groupoid}</script>. Even better, these two example choices of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{H}</script> give us homotopically equivalent objects, by the homotopy hypothesis.</p>

<p>This is really nice for many reasons, but one particularly nice one is that singular cohomology with coefficients in <script type="math/tex">A</script> is <em>representable</em>, and it is pretty much represented exactly by <script type="math/tex">A</script>. There is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Brown+representability+theorem">theorem</a> that tells us that, in particular, any sufficiently well-behaved cohomology theory is representable in this way.</p>

<h2>Spectra</h2>

<p>So with all this talk around spectra, it‚Äôs time to actually define them. Like many concepts, there are a bunch of different models and settings, and we‚Äôre not going to explore most of them, but instead focus on <strong>sequential pre-spectra</strong> and <strong><script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectra</strong>.</p>

<h3>The setting (infinity categories)</h3>

<p>First of all we work in <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> and keep our example of <script type="math/tex">K(A,n)</script> in mind. Here, we define a <strong>sequential pre-spectrum <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script></strong> to be a sequence <script type="math/tex">(\mathcal{E}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</script> of pointed spaces, along with the data of <strong>structure maps</strong>, which are continuous maps <script type="math/tex">\Sigma \mathcal{E}_n\to \mathcal{E}_{n+1}</script>. Then, using the adjunction <script type="math/tex">(\Sigma\dashv\Omega)</script>, we can turn these structure maps into maps <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}_n\to\Omega \mathcal{E}_{n+1}</script>. If these are isomorphisms<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">7</a></sup> then we say that <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script> is an <strong><script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum</strong>.</p>

<p>Our previous example of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}_n=K(A,n)</script> then gives us an <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum. And we see that spectra can be viewed as a generalisation of infinitely-deloopable objects.</p>

<p>In the bigger picture, every sequential pre-spectrum has a <strong>spectrification</strong>, which is an equivalent <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum given by a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spectrum#OmegaSpectrum">certain filtered colimit</a>, and these <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectra are exactly the fibrant replacements in some model structure.</p>

<p>Generally, we can define <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spectrum+object#via_spectrum_objects"><script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectrum objects in any <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category</a>, but when people talk about ‚Äòspectra‚Äô with no reference to a specific category, it‚Äôs usually implicit that they are working in <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> with weak homotopy equivalences.</p>

<p>But the ‚Äòhonest‚Äô setting for spectra is in a <strong>stable <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category</strong>: pointed<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">8</a></sup> <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-categories <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> with finite limits, where the loop <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-functor <script type="math/tex">\Omega\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}</script> is an <em>equivalence</em>, with the inverse given by suspension <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script>. Given some not-necessarily-stable pointed <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> with finite limits, we can form its <strong>stabilisation</strong> by taking the limit<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">9</a></sup> of iterating the loop space functor on the category of <strong>pointed objects of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script></strong>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Stab}(\mathcal{C}) := \lim_{\leftarrow}\big(\ldots\to(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\Omega}(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\Omega}(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})\big).</script>

<p>The prototypical example of such a category is exactly what we‚Äôve been looking at: <em><script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Stab}(\mathsf{Top})</script> is the category of <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>-spectra in <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script></em>. In general, we can construct <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Stab}(\mathcal{C})</script> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608228">exactly by taking the category of spectrum objects</a> in <script type="math/tex">(*\downarrow\mathcal{C})</script>.</p>

<p>A really good introduction to all of this, and where I actually saw most of this for the first time, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2925">Moritz Groth‚Äôs <em>A short course on <script type="math/tex">\infty</script>-categories</em></a>.</p>

<p>This is all understood much better when we bring operads into the picture. In the next post in this series I‚Äôll try to show how certain spectra are ‚Äòjust commutative monoids‚Äô, and that commutative monoids in an <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category are ‚Äòjust <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-algebras‚Äô.</p>

<h3>Nice properties</h3>

<p>Before wrapping this post up, I‚Äôm just going to mention briefly something that always confused me about spectra that represent cohomology theories.</p>

<p>We can define ‚Äòcohomology‚Äô in any <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-category <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{H}</script> by just setting <script type="math/tex">H(X,A):=\pi_0\mathbb{H}(X,A)</script>, but if we want this to behave like ‚Äòusual‚Äô cohomology then we have to impose some restrictions. First of all, if we want our ‚Äòcocycles‚Äô to classify something (namely principal bundles over <script type="math/tex">X</script>) then we have to be working in an <em><script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-topos</em>. Secondly, if we want to obtain a <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}</script>-graded cohomology then the simplest way<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> of doing so is to ask that our coefficient object <script type="math/tex">A</script> be a <em>component of a spectrum object</em>, i.e. <script type="math/tex">A=\mathcal{E}_n</script> for some spectrum object <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script>. Thirdly, if we want our cohomology to have a group structure then we need<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> <script type="math/tex">A</script> to be a <em>group object</em>, which is always the case if <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a component of a spectrum object.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> Note that this is abelian if <script type="math/tex">A</script> is at least an <script type="math/tex">E_2</script>-object. Finally, if we want a ring structure then we can ask that the spectrum object <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E}</script> of which <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a component be an <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-ring, or a <em>ring spectra</em>.</p>

<p>The point here is that, cohomology can be defined very generally, but if we want to recover something that we really recognise from it then we can basically restrict ourselves to looking at <strong>ring spectra in an <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-topos</strong>.</p>

<h2>That ‚Äòclassical fact‚Äô</h2>

<p>A full and good proof (of the fact in question but also much more besides) can be found in Chapter 4.3 of <a href="https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Hatcher‚Äôs <em>Algebraic Topology</em></a>. I‚Äôll be content here to give a small sketch, as found in e.g. <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~mbehrens/18.906/notes/lec15.pdf">these lecture notes</a>.</p>

<p>By the universal coefficient theorem, there is a short exact sequence</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0\to \mathrm{Ext}^1_\mathbb{Z}(H_{n-1}(K(A,n),A)) \to H^n(K(A,n),A) \to \mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(H_n(K(A,n),A),A) \to0.</script>

<p>Then, by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurewicz_theorem">Hurewicz theorem</a>, we have an isomorphism</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">H^n(K(A,n),A)\xrightarrow{\sim}\mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(A,A).</script>

<p>Now take the class of <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{id}_A</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(A,A)</script> and look at its image <script type="math/tex">[\iota_n]</script> in <script type="math/tex">H^n(K(A,n),A)</script>. This gives us a natural (in <script type="math/tex">X</script>) transformation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
\eta_X\colon\pi_0\mathsf{Top}_*(X,K(A,n))&\to H^n(X,A)\\
[\gamma]&\mapsto \gamma^*([\iota_n])
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>and we claim that it is a natural isomorphism when we restrict to the subcategory of pointed CW complexes.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This ‚Äòclassical fact‚Äô is really a key example of the so-called <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eckmann-Hilton+duality">Eckmann-Hilton duality</a>.</p>

TI"%I have been reading recently about spectra and their use in defining cohomology theories. Something that came up quite a lot was the idea of **$$E_\infty$$-algebras**, which I knew roughly corresponded to some commutative version of $$A_\infty$$-algebras, but beyond that I knew nothing. After some enlightening discussions with one of my supervisors, I feel like I'm starting to see how the ideas of spectra, $$E_\infty$$-algebras, and operads all fit together. In an attempt to solidify this understanding and pinpoint any difficulties, I'm going to try to write up what I 'understand' so far.

The rough idea is to study loop spaces and consider their 'generalisation' as homotopy pullbacks, then to define **spectrum objects** in stable $$(\infty,1)$$-categories.  We also consider why we can call $$A_\infty$$-algebras 'generalised loop spaces'.
Then we will have a look at the $$E_\infty$$ and $$A_\infty$$ operads and try to describe the algebras over them, before seeing how this is linked to the idea of **spectra** (spectrum objects in the category of topological spaces).

After this, I might do a series on the uses of spectra, like 'nice' cohomology theories in $$(\infty,1)$$-topoi, and 'brave new geometry' in the framework of To√´n and Vezzosi's homotopical algebraic geometry.

_There probably won't be many references or pictures to begin with, but I will try to come back and add some at some point in the hopefully not-too-distant future._

## Loop spaces

### Classical approach

Given some topological space $$X$$, we have many good reasons to be interested in its fundamental group. That is, we are interested in what happens to **loops** (maps from $$S^1$$ to $$X$$) in our space when we consider everything up to homotopy. With this in mind, we define the **(pointed) loop space $$\Omega(X,x)$$ of $$X$$ at some point $$x\in X$$** as the mapping space

$$\Omega(X,x):=\mathrm{Map}_*\big(S^1,(X,x)\big)$$

which has a base point given by the constant map to $$x$$, and where we consider $$S^1$$ as a pointed space with some (fixed) base point $$s\in S^1$$ (e.g. embed $$S^1$$ into $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ and let $$s=(1,0)$$).

Now, by definition, we have an isomorphism of groups $$\pi_0\Omega(X,x)\cong\pi_1(X,x)$$, since elements of the latter are classes of homotopy-equivalent paths, which are the same as classes of points of the former, where we identify points if there is a path between them.
This suggestive isomorphism makes us wonder if there are 'higher' loop spaces $$\Omega^i(X,x)$$ such that $$\pi_i(X,x)\cong\pi_0\Omega^i(X,x)$$.
The answer is, as you would hope, yes.
In fact, we can just iterate loop spaces to obtain such objects: we define the **$$i$$-fold loop space** as

$$\Omega^i(X,x):=\Omega\big(\Omega^{i-1}(X,x)\big).$$

### Suspensions and smashing

This definition of higher loop spaces might be a tad surprising in so far as one might have expected 'higher loops' to be defined as maps from 'higher spheres', and thus to have defined the $$i$$-fold loop space as

$$\Omega^i(X,x):=\mathrm{Map}_*\big(S^i,(X,x)\big).$$

It is a beautiful convenience that these two proposed definitions agree, and the story goes as follows.

The category $$\mathsf{Top}_*$$ of pointed topological spaces admits the structure of a symmetric monoidal category,[^1] where the product is the **smash product**, given by

$$X\wedge Y:=\frac{X\times Y}{X\vee Y}$$

and where $$X\vee Y$$ is the **wedge sum**, given by identifying base points.
It would be tantamount to a crime to not put in any pictures here, so below are some examples.

**INSERT PICTURES**

In fact, $$\mathsf{Top}_*$$ is a *closed* symmetric monoidal category:[^2] we have the adjunction $$(\wedge\dashv\mathsf{Top}_*)$$, and thus the natural isomorphism

$$\mathsf{Top}_*(X\wedge Y, Z)\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(X,\mathsf{Top}_*(Y,Z)).$$

In particular then, taking $$Y=S^1$$, we see that

$$\mathsf{Top}_*(X\wedge S^1, Z)\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(X,\Omega(Z,z))$$

naturally in both $$X$$ and $$Z$$, so defining the **(reduced)[^3] suspension** of $$X$$ as $$\Sigma X:=X\wedge S^1$$ gives us an adjunction $$(\Sigma\dashv\Omega)$$.
But now we notice that _if we can show that $$\Sigma S^i\simeq S^{i+1}$$_ then

$$\mathsf{Top}_*(S^i,(X,x))\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(S^{i-1},\Omega(X,x))\cong\ldots\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(S^1,\Omega^i(X,x))$$

whence the two possible definitions of higher loop spaces agree.

We can actually prove a stronger statement: $$S^i\wedge S^j\simeq S^{i+j}$$.
To 'see' this, we consider $$S^i$$ as a cell complex with cells $$e^0\sqcup e^i$$.
Then

$$S^i\wedge S^j\simeq\frac{e^0\sqcup e^j\sqcup e^i\sqcup e^{i+j}}{e^0\sqcup e^i\sqcup e^j}\simeq e^0\sqcup e^{i+j}.$$

### Homotopy pullbacks

We claim that the loop space construction can also be described as the homotopy pullback of $$X$$ along the base point $$x\colon*\to X$$. That is, we want to realise

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
    A &\to &* \\
    \downarrow & \lrcorner&\downarrow \\
    * &\to &X
\end{array}$$

as the loop space $$\Omega(X,x)$$ we defined previously.
But now we use a 'simple' trick:[^4] replace the point with the contractible space $$\\\{\gamma\colon[0,1]\to X \mid \gamma(0)=x\\\}$$, and map this into $$X$$ by sending $$\gamma$$ to $$\gamma(1)$$. Then $$A$$ is exactly the space of maps $$D^1\to X$$ based at $$x$$ (i.e with $$\gamma(0)=x$$) such that $$\gamma(1)=x$$ as well, and this is exactly $$\Omega(X,x)$$.

Dually, the (reduced) suspension can be realised as the homotopy pushout

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
    X &\to &* \\
    \downarrow & \ulcorner&\downarrow \\
    * &\to &B
\end{array}$$

or, said in a different way,[^5] as the mapping cone of the terminal map $$X\to *$$.

### Sneak peek at $$A_\infty$$-algebras

In one of Stasheff's theses, in the 60s, he formalised the idea of algebras that behave 'like loop spaces' in that they have a multiplication structure that is only associative _up to some higher homotopies_. These are called **$$A_\infty$$-algebras**, and there are plenty of classic introductions to them in their own right. The 'most classic' is probably _[Keller, Bernhard (2001). Introduction to A-infinity algebras and modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9910179)_, which also describes (in ¬ß2.2) what I'm going to briefly sketch out below (and will cover in more detail in the future): how loop spaces are 'almost associative algebras'.

Given two loops, $$\gamma_1$$ and $$\gamma_2$$ in $$X$$, we can define their 'product' $$\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2$$ as their composition: we 'do/follow/trace out' the loop $$\gamma_1$$ followed immediately by the loop $$\gamma_2$$. Clearly we have some identity element under this product, as well as inverses, and associativity is 'obvious' because following the first loop then the second, and _then_ the third is the same as following the first, and _then_ the second and the third, right?

I mean, obviously here there is some caveat so that the actual answer is _no_, but I think that making this mistake is in some way a good thing, because it means that we're thinking homotopically without maybe even realising it.[^6] The problem with associativity comes from the fact that we have picked some model of $$S^1$$, namely $$[0,1]$$, and so our composed loops have to respect this. That is, we can't just define $$\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2$$ as the obvious map $$[0,2]\to X$$; we have to scale the paths so that $$\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2\colon[0,1]\to X$$. This is easy enough: we do $$\gamma_1(t/2)$$ for $$0\leqslant t\leqslant\frac12$$ and $$\gamma_2((t+1)/2)$$ for $$\frac12\leqslant t\leqslant1$$.
But the problem then arises that $$(\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2)\cdot\gamma_3\neq\gamma_1\cdot(\gamma_2\cdot\gamma_2)$$ (this might be better explained in the pictures below), although they are clearly homotopic. Then, however, we have a similar problem when we want to look at $$\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2\cdot\gamma_3\cdot\gamma_4$$, but now we have many[^7] ways of bracketing this. All possible ways will be homotopic, of course, but there is a lot of structure contained in this information of _how_ the different choices are homotopic, and if we can somehow remember all of this then maybe we will gain something from it.

[^1]: Careful here: we need to be working with '[nice enough](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/convenient+category+of+topological+spaces)' spaces, otherwise this product [isn't associative (not even weakly)](https://mathoverflow.net/a/76594/73622).
[^2]: This needs proving, but I'm not gonna do that here because half of the fun of writing these posts is that I can just talk about the ideas themselves, and not repeat proofs that I don't want to have to type out. It's also nice to escape from the usual 'definition, theorem, proof' format. But for a proof of this particular claim see e.g. [the nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pointed+object#ClosedMonoidalStructure) (although they also refer elsewhere for a proof so I feel less bad for doing so).
[^3]: There is also the notion of a **non-reduced suspension**, but in a lot of cases these two constructions give objects that are weakly homotopic to one another.
[^4]: This trick will turn up again in a future part of this series, when we talk about the **little discs operad**.

Then, however, we have a similar problem when we want to look at <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2\cdot\gamma_3\cdot\gamma_4</script>, but now we have many<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> ways of bracketing this. All possible ways will be homotopic, of course, but there is a lot of structure contained in this information of <em>how</em> the different choices are homotopic, and if we can somehow remember all of this then maybe we will gain something from it.</p>

        <p>I have been reading recently about spectra and their use in defining cohomology theories. Something that came up quite a lot was the idea of <strong><script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-algebras</strong>, which I knew roughly corresponded to some commutative version of <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras, but beyond that I knew nothing. After some enlightening discussions with one of my supervisors, I feel like I‚Äôm starting to see how the ideas of spectra, <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-algebras, and operads all fit together. In an attempt to solidify this understanding and pinpoint any difficulties, I‚Äôm going to try to write up what I ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô so far.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>The rough idea is to study loop spaces and consider their ‚Äògeneralisation‚Äô as homotopy pullbacks, then to define <strong>spectrum objects</strong> in stable <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-categories.  We also consider why we can call <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras ‚Äògeneralised loop spaces‚Äô.
Then we will have a look at the <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script> and <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script> operads and try to describe the algebras over them, before seeing how this is linked to the idea of <strong>spectra</strong> (spectrum objects in the category of topological spaces).</p>

<p>After this, I might do a series on the uses of spectra, like ‚Äònice‚Äô cohomology theories in <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-topoi, and ‚Äòbrave new geometry‚Äô in the framework of To√´n and Vezzosi‚Äôs homotopical algebraic geometry.</p>

<p><em>There probably won‚Äôt be many references or pictures to begin with, but I will try to come back and add some at some point in the hopefully not-too-distant future.</em></p>

<h2>Loop spaces</h2>

<h3>Classical approach</h3>

<p>Given some topological space <script type="math/tex">X</script>, we have many good reasons to be interested in its fundamental group. That is, we are interested in what happens to <strong>loops</strong> (maps from <script type="math/tex">S^1</script> to <script type="math/tex">X</script>) in our space when we consider everything up to homotopy. With this in mind, we define the <strong>(pointed) loop space <script type="math/tex">\Omega(X,x)</script> of <script type="math/tex">X</script> at some point <script type="math/tex">x\in X</script></strong> as the mapping space</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Omega(X,x):=\mathrm{Map}_*\big(S^1,(X,x)\big)</script>

<p>which has a base point given by the constant map to <script type="math/tex">x</script>, and where we consider <script type="math/tex">S^1</script> as a pointed space with some (fixed) base point <script type="math/tex">s\in S^1</script> (e.g. embed <script type="math/tex">S^1</script> into <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2</script> and let <script type="math/tex">s=(1,0)</script>).</p>

<p>Now, by definition, we have an isomorphism of groups <script type="math/tex">\pi_0\Omega(X,x)\cong\pi_1(X,x)</script>, since elements of the latter are classes of homotopy-equivalent paths, which are the same as classes of points of the former, where we identify points if there is a path between them.
This suggestive isomorphism makes us wonder if there are ‚Äòhigher‚Äô loop spaces <script type="math/tex">\Omega^i(X,x)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\pi_i(X,x)\cong\pi_0\Omega^i(X,x)</script>.
The answer is, as you would hope, yes.
In fact, we can just iterate loop spaces to obtain such objects: we define the <strong><script type="math/tex">i</script>-fold loop space</strong> as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Omega^i(X,x):=\Omega\big(\Omega^{i-1}(X,x)\big).</script>

<h3>Suspensions and smashing</h3>

<p>This definition of higher loop spaces might be a tad surprising in so far as one might have expected ‚Äòhigher loops‚Äô to be defined as maps from ‚Äòhigher spheres‚Äô, and thus to have defined the <script type="math/tex">i</script>-fold loop space as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Omega^i(X,x):=\mathrm{Map}_*\big(S^i,(X,x)\big).</script>

<p>It is a beautiful convenience that these two proposed definitions agree, and the story goes as follows.</p>

<p>The category <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> of pointed topological spaces admits the structure of a symmetric monoidal category,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> where the product is the <strong>smash product</strong>, given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">X\wedge Y:=\frac{X\times Y}{X\vee Y}</script>

<p>and where <script type="math/tex">X\vee Y</script> is the <strong>wedge sum</strong>, given by identifying base points.
It would be tantamount to a crime to not put in any pictures here, so below are some examples.</p>

<p><strong>INSERT PICTURES</strong></p>

<p>In fact, <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> is a <em>closed</em> symmetric monoidal category:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> we have the adjunction <script type="math/tex">(\wedge\dashv\mathsf{Top}_*)</script>, and thus the natural isomorphism</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Top}_*(X\wedge Y, Z)\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(X,\mathsf{Top}_*(Y,Z)).</script>

<p>In particular then, taking <script type="math/tex">Y=S^1</script>, we see that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Top}_*(X\wedge S^1, Z)\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(X,\Omega(Z,z))</script>

<p>naturally in both <script type="math/tex">X</script> and <script type="math/tex">Z</script>, so defining the <strong>(reduced)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> suspension</strong> of <script type="math/tex">X</script> as <script type="math/tex">\Sigma X:=X\wedge S^1</script> gives us an adjunction <script type="math/tex">(\Sigma\dashv\Omega)</script>.
But now we notice that <em>if we can show that <script type="math/tex">\Sigma S^i\simeq S^{i+1}</script></em> then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Top}_*(S^i,(X,x))\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(S^{i-1},\Omega(X,x))\cong\ldots\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(S^1,\Omega^i(X,x))</script>

<p>whence the two possible definitions of higher loop spaces agree.</p>

<p>We can actually prove a stronger statement: <script type="math/tex">S^i\wedge S^j\simeq S^{i+j}</script>.
To ‚Äòsee‚Äô this, we consider <script type="math/tex">S^i</script> as a cell complex with cells <script type="math/tex">e^0\sqcup e^i</script>.
Then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S^i\wedge S^j\simeq\frac{e^0\sqcup e^j\sqcup e^i\sqcup e^{i+j}}{e^0\sqcup e^i\sqcup e^j}\simeq e^0\sqcup e^{i+j}.</script>

<h3>Homotopy pullbacks</h3>

<p>We claim that the loop space construction can also be described as the homotopy pullback of <script type="math/tex">X</script> along the base point <script type="math/tex">x\colon*\to X</script>. That is, we want to realise</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
    A &\to &* \\
    \downarrow & \lrcorner&\downarrow \\
    * &\to &X
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>as the loop space <script type="math/tex">\Omega(X,x)</script> we defined previously.
But now we use a ‚Äòsimple‚Äô trick:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> replace the point with the contractible space <script type="math/tex">\\\{\gamma\colon[0,1]\to X \mid \gamma(0)=x\\\}</script>, and map this into <script type="math/tex">X</script> by sending <script type="math/tex">\gamma</script> to <script type="math/tex">\gamma(1)</script>. Then <script type="math/tex">A</script> is exactly the space of maps <script type="math/tex">D^1\to X</script> based at <script type="math/tex">x</script> (i.e with <script type="math/tex">\gamma(0)=x</script>) such that <script type="math/tex">\gamma(1)=x</script> as well, and this is exactly <script type="math/tex">\Omega(X,x)</script>.</p>

<p>Dually, the (reduced) suspension can be realised as the homotopy pushout</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
    X &\to &* \\
    \downarrow & \ulcorner&\downarrow \\
    * &\to &B
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>or, said in a different way,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> as the mapping cone of the terminal map <script type="math/tex">X\to *</script>.</p>

<h3>Sneak peek at <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras</h3>

<p>In one of Stasheff‚Äôs theses, in the 60s, he formalised the idea of algebras that behave ‚Äòlike loop spaces‚Äô in that they have a multiplication structure that is only associative <em>up to some higher homotopies</em>. These are called <strong><script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras</strong>, and there are plenty of classic introductions to them in their own right. The ‚Äòmost classic‚Äô is probably <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9910179">Keller, Bernhard (2001). Introduction to A-infinity algebras and modules</a></em>, which also describes (in ¬ß2.2) what I‚Äôm going to briefly sketch out below (and will cover in more detail in the future): how loop spaces are ‚Äòalmost associative algebras‚Äô.</p>

<p>Given two loops, <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\gamma_2</script> in <script type="math/tex">X</script>, we can define their ‚Äòproduct‚Äô <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2</script> as their composition: we ‚Äòdo/follow/trace out‚Äô the loop <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1</script> followed immediately by the loop <script type="math/tex">\gamma_2</script>. Clearly we have some identity element under this product, as well as inverses, and associativity is ‚Äòobvious‚Äô because following the first loop then the second, and <em>then</em> the third is the same as following the first, and <em>then</em> the second and the third, right?</p>

<p>I mean, obviously here there is some caveat so that the actual answer is <em>no</em>, but I think that making this mistake is in some way a good thing, because it means that we‚Äôre thinking homotopically without maybe even realising it.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> The problem with associativity comes from the fact that we have picked some model of <script type="math/tex">S^1</script>, namely <script type="math/tex">[0,1]</script>, and so our composed loops have to respect this. That is, we can‚Äôt just define <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2</script> as the obvious map <script type="math/tex">[0,2]\to X</script>; we have to scale the paths so that <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2\colon[0,1]\to X</script>. This is easy enough: we do <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1(t/2)</script> for <script type="math/tex">0\leqslant t\leqslant\frac12</script> and <script type="math/tex">\gamma_2((t+1)/2)</script> for <script type="math/tex">\frac12\leqslant t\leqslant1</script>.
But the problem then arises that <script type="math/tex">(\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2)\cdot\gamma_3\neq\gamma_1\cdot(\gamma_2\cdot\gamma_2)</script> (this might be better explained in the pictures below), although they are clearly homotopic. Then, however, we have a similar problem when we want to look at <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2\cdot\gamma_3\cdot\gamma_4</script>, but now we have many<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> ways of bracketing this. All possible ways will be homotopic, of course, but there is a lot of structure contained in this information of <em>how</em> the different choices are homotopic, and if we can somehow remember all of this then maybe we will gain something from it.</p>

TI"ßA motto of category theory is that 'Kan extensions are everywhere'. As a
simplification of this, '(co)limits are in a lot of places'. By rephrasing
the definition of a limit we end up with something that looks invitingly
generalisable. This is how we can stumble across the idea of a
**weighted limit**. In this post I'm going to assume that you are already
convinced of the usefulness and omnipresence of limits and not talk too much
(if at all) about why they are interesting in their own right.

---

**Edit:** If you actually want to learn this stuff then have a look at either of Emily Riehl's books ([Categorical Homotopy Theory](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/cathtpy.pdf) and [Category Theory in Context](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf)).
I honestly don't think there is a better teaching of this anywhere else in the literature.

*This is the first in a series of notes that are basically summaries of various
pages on the nLab, along with a few other sources. There is nothing original
here, except any mistakes.*


## Motivation

We start by rephrasing what it means for an object to be the limit of a functor
in terms of representable presheaves.

### For sets

Let $$F\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathsf{Set}$$ be a presheaf on a small category
$$I$$. Then the limit of $$F$$ over $$I$$ is the hom-set

$$\lim_I F := [I,\mathsf{Set}] (\underline{\{*\}},F)$$

where $$[I,\mathsf{Set}]$$ is the functor category, and $$\underline{\{*\}}$$ is the
constant functor to a singleton set. Since the covariant hom functor commutes
with set-valued limits, we can use the Yoneda lemma, as always, to work with
$$\hat{Y}(\lim_I F) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(-,\lim_I F)$$ and see that

$$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(S,\lim_I F) \cong \lim_I\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(S,F(-))$$

for any set $$S$$.

### For small categories

If we now find ourselves in the more general case of having a functor¬†
$$F\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{C}$$ for some arbitrary (small) category
$$\mathcal{C}$$ then we can use the above trick: we define the presheaf
$$\widehat{\lim}_I F$$ by using the set-valued limit above, i.e.

$$(\widehat{\lim}_I F)(c) \cong \hat{\mathcal{C}}(\hat{Y}(c), \widehat{\lim}_I F) := \lim_I\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))$$

where $$\hat{\mathcal{C}}$$ is the presheaf category
$$[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathsf{Set}]$$, and we write $$\mathcal{D}(x,y)$$ to
mean $$\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{D}(x,y)$$. But by the definition of the limit given
at the start, this can be rewritten (''setting
$$F =¬†\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))$$'') as

$$(\widehat{\lim}_I F)(c) \cong \hat{I}\big(\underline{\{*\}},\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))\big).$$

It can then be shown that the limit of $$F$$, as defined in any other classical
way, is exactly an object representing the presheaf $$\widehat{\lim}_I F$$, i.e.

$$\mathcal{C}(c, \lim_I F)\cong\hat{I}\big(\underline{\{*\}},\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))\big)$$

## Generalisation

There are two things in the above that look interesting to try to
generalise:

1.  Consider something more complicated than terminal cones: replace
    $$\underline{\{*\}}$$ with some arbitrary functor $$W\in\hat{I}$$ (that will be
    called the **weight**);
2.  Work in $$\mathcal{V}$$-enriched categories rather than just
    $$\mathsf{Set}$$-enriched (i.e small) ones.

This leads to the following definition. Let $$\mathcal{C}$$ be a
$$\mathcal{V}$$-enriched category, and $$W\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{V}$$ and
$$F\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{C}$$ functors. The **$$W$$-weighted limit of $$F$$**
is (if it exists) an object $$\lim^W F\in\mathcal{C}$$ that represents (for
$$c\in\mathcal{C}$$) the functor

$$[I,\mathcal{V}]\big(W,\mathcal{C}(c,F(-))\big)\colon\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{V}.$$

In particular, if $$\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{V}$$ then you can show that
$$\lim^W F\cong [I,\mathcal{V}](W,F)$$.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you actually want to learn this stuff then have a look at either of Emily Riehl‚Äôs books (<a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/cathtpy.pdf">Categorical Homotopy Theory</a> and <a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf">Category Theory in Context</a>).
I honestly don‚Äôt think there is a better teaching of this anywhere else in the literature.</p>

<p><em>This is the first in a series of notes that are basically summaries of various
pages on the nLab, along with a few other sources. There is nothing original
here, except any mistakes.</em></p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>We start by rephrasing what it means for an object to be the limit of a functor
in terms of representable presheaves.</p>

<h3>For sets</h3>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">F\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathsf{Set}</script> be a presheaf on a small category
<script type="math/tex">I</script>. Then the limit of <script type="math/tex">F</script> over <script type="math/tex">I</script> is the hom-set</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lim_I F := [I,\mathsf{Set}] (\underline{\{*\}},F)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">[I,\mathsf{Set}]</script> is the functor category, and <script type="math/tex">\underline{\{*\}}</script> is the
constant functor to a singleton set. Since the covariant hom functor commutes
with set-valued limits, we can use the Yoneda lemma, as always, to work with
<script type="math/tex">\hat{Y}(\lim_I F) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(-,\lim_I F)</script> and see that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(S,\lim_I F) \cong \lim_I\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(S,F(-))</script>

<p>for any set <script type="math/tex">S</script>.</p>

<h3>For small categories</h3>

<p>If we now find ourselves in the more general case of having a functor¬†
<script type="math/tex">F\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{C}</script> for some arbitrary (small) category
<script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> then we can use the above trick: we define the presheaf
<script type="math/tex">\widehat{\lim}_I F</script> by using the set-valued limit above, i.e.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\widehat{\lim}_I F)(c) \cong \hat{\mathcal{C}}(\hat{Y}(c), \widehat{\lim}_I F) := \lim_I\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathcal{C}}</script> is the presheaf category
<script type="math/tex">[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathsf{Set}]</script>, and we write <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{D}(x,y)</script> to
mean <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{D}(x,y)</script>. But by the definition of the limit given
at the start, this can be rewritten (‚Äò‚Äòsetting
<script type="math/tex">F =¬†\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))</script>‚Äô‚Äô) as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\widehat{\lim}_I F)(c) \cong \hat{I}\big(\underline{\{*\}},\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))\big).</script>

<p>It can then be shown that the limit of <script type="math/tex">F</script>, as defined in any other classical
way, is exactly an object representing the presheaf <script type="math/tex">\widehat{\lim}_I F</script>, i.e.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{C}(c, \lim_I F)\cong\hat{I}\big(\underline{\{*\}},\mathsf{Set}(\hat{Y}(c),F(-))\big)</script>

<h2>Generalisation</h2>

<p>There are two things in the above that look interesting to try to
generalise:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Consider something more complicated than terminal cones: replace
<script type="math/tex">\underline{\{*\}}</script> with some arbitrary functor <script type="math/tex">W\in\hat{I}</script> (that will be
called the <strong>weight</strong>);</li>
  <li>Work in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-enriched categories rather than just
<script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Set}</script>-enriched (i.e small) ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>This leads to the following definition. Let <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}</script> be a
<script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script>-enriched category, and <script type="math/tex">W\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{V}</script> and
<script type="math/tex">F\colon I^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{C}</script> functors. The <strong><script type="math/tex">W</script>-weighted limit of <script type="math/tex">F</script></strong>
is (if it exists) an object <script type="math/tex">\lim^W F\in\mathcal{C}</script> that represents (for
<script type="math/tex">c\in\mathcal{C}</script>) the functor</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[I,\mathcal{V}]\big(W,\mathcal{C}(c,F(-))\big)\colon\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\to\mathcal{V}.</script>

<p>In particular, if <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{V}</script> then you can show that
<script type="math/tex">\lim^W F\cong [I,\mathcal{V}](W,F)</script>.</p>

<p><em>In the next post we‚Äôll have a look at *why* this generalisation is of
any interest, and how we can use it to define (co)ends.</em></p>

        <p>In my thesis, switching between vector bundles and principal <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r</script>-bundles has often made certain problems easier (or harder) to understand.
Due to my innate fear of all things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz‚Äôs (absolutely fantastic) book <a href="https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642">Principal Bundles ‚Äî The Classical Case</a>, I‚Äôve really grown quite fond of bundles, especially when you start talking about all the lovely <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}G</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{E}G</script> things therein<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Point is, I haven‚Äôt posted anything in forever, and one of my supervisor‚Äôs strong pedagogical beliefs is that <em>‚Äòaffine vector spaces should be understood as <script type="math/tex">G</script>-torsors, where <script type="math/tex">G</script> is the underlying vector space acting via translation‚Äô</em>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> which makes a nice short topic of discussion, whence this post.</p>

Both of them seemed to be some sort of quotienting/equivalence-class-like action, so why not do them at the same time?
What different roles were played by each step?</p>

I was lucky enough to get the chance to talk about twisting cochains and twisted complexes for half an hour, and you can find the slides on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/thosgood/papers/blob/master/twisting-cochains-YTM19/twisting-cochains-YTM19-handout.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p>What with all the wild applications of, and progress in, the theory of <script type="math/tex">\infty</script>-categories, I had really neglected studying any kind of lower higher-category theory.
But, as in many other ways, CT2019 opened my eyes somewhat, and now I‚Äôm trying to catch up on the theory of 2-categories, which have some really beautiful structure and examples.</p>

        <p>In my thesis, switching between vector bundles and principal <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r</script>-bundles has often made certain problems easier (or harder) to understand.
Due to my innate fear of all things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz‚Äôs (absolutely fantastic) book <a href="https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642">Principal Bundles ‚Äî The Classical Case</a>, I‚Äôve really grown quite fond of bundles, especially when you start talking about all the lovely <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}G</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{E}G</script> things therein<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Point is, I haven‚Äôt posted anything in forever, and one of my supervisor‚Äôs strong pedagogical beliefs is that <em>‚Äòaffine vector spaces should be understood as <script type="math/tex">G</script>-torsors, where <script type="math/tex">G</script> is the underlying vector space acting via translation‚Äô</em>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> which makes a nice short topic of discussion, whence this post.</p>

In particular, as an undergraduate I was always confused as to what the difference was between the two steps of constructing the derived category of chain complexes was: taking equivalence classes of chain homotopic complexes; and then formally inverting all quasi-isomorphisms.
Both of them seemed to be some sort of quotienting/equivalence-class-like action, so why not do them at the same time?
What different roles were played by each step?</p>

  CUSTOM MEDIA QUERIES

  Media query values can be changed to fit your own content.
  There are no magic bullets when it comes to media query width values.
  They should be declared in em units - and they should be set to meet
  the needs of your content. You can also add additional media queries,
  or remove some of the existing ones.

  These media queries can be referenced like so:

  @media (--breakpoint-not-small) {
    .medium-and-larger-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }

  @media (--breakpoint-medium) {
    .medium-screen-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }

  @media (--breakpoint-large) {
    .large-and-larger-screen-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }
