Having finished my defence (entirely virtually, and hence, of course, plagued with many technical difficulties), I have now been able to share my thesis with the world. Most of the technical content can already be found in my two preprints ([part I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10023) and [part II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10591)), but I think the thesis is a much more self-contained and leisurely read, with a lot more examples and (hopefully) helpful appendices. It also has geese! You can find a copy of it on [here on TEL](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02882140/document).
