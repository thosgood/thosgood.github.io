This is really just a cross-post announcement: I wrote [a post over on the Topos blog](https://topos.institute/blog/2021/11/left-adjoints-lenses-and-localisation/), but it's something I've been thinking about a lot, so I wanted to share a link to it here as well.
It's basically the result of me, knowing a bit about derived categories and model categories, trying to digest this lovely bit of Australian category theory by [Bryce Clarke](https://bryceclarke.github.io/) concerning [internal lenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06835v1).
In fact, it's really a fermented and distilled version of an old blog post from here, namely [*Cauchy completion and profunctors*](/blog/2019-07-14-cauchy-completion-and-profunctors/).

I won't copy the contents of the entire post here, but I will just repeat the question that I ask at the end (and will refer anybody interested in more context over to [my post](https://topos.institute/blog/2021/11/left-adjoints-lenses-and-localisation/)).

> Is there some setting in which I could say something like (maybe swapping “projective” for “injective”) the following:
> cofunctors are the morphisms in some “derived” category;
> weak equivalences are bijective-on-objects functors;
> fibrations are discrete opfibrations;
> the category does not have enough projectives;
> lenses correspond (via looking at their domain) to K-projective objects.
