I have just come back from CT2019 in Edinburgh, and it was a fantastic week. There were a bunch of really interesting talks, and I had a chance to meet some lovely people. I also got to tell people about [`#math.CT:matrix.org`](https://www.matrix.to/#/#math.CT:matrix.org), and so hopefully that will start to pick up in the not-too-distant future.

In no particular order, and with many glaring omissions, here are the slides from some of the talks that I really enjoyed:

- [A formal category theory for $\infty$-categories (Emily Riehl)](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/slides/riehl.pdf)
- [Segal-type models of weak $n$-categories (Simona Paoli)](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/slides/paoli.pdf)
