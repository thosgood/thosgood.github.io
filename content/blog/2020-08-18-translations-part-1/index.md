I've been having quite a bit of fun translating some maths papers into English recently.
Of course, I'm still chugging away at the [EGA translation project](https://github.com/ryankeleti/ega), having just finished another section of EGA II, leaving "only" about 60 pages left before that chapter will be done as well!
However, I've started putting some of my other translations all together, and they can now be found at <https://thosgood.net/translations>.
There are a lot still in progress, but here's a summary of what I've done so far.

<!-- more -->

There are two nice articles:

- Borel, A. and Serre, J.-P. "Le théorème de Riemann-Roch". _Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France_, Volume **86** (1958), pp. 97--136. DOI: [10.24033/bsmf.1500](https://www.doi.org/10.24033/bsmf.1500).
- Grothendieck, A. "La théorie des classes de Chern". _Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France_, Volume **86** (1958) , pp. 137--154. DOI: [10.24033/bsmf.1501](https://www.doi.org/10.24033/bsmf.1501).

I've made a start on Grothendieck's FGA:

- "Théorème de dualité pour les faisceaux algébriques cohérents". _Séminaire Bourbaki_, Volume **9** (1956--57), Talk no. 149.

Then there are some of the ENS/IHES lectures, such as the _Séminaire Claude Chevalley_, Volume **4** (1958--59) "Variétés de Picard":

- Talk no. 1: "Faisceaux quasi-cohérents" (P. Gabriel).
- Talk no. 2: "Le théorème de Serre" (P. Gabriel).
- Talk no. 4: "Diviseurs en géométrie algébrique" (C.S. Seshadri).

At the moment, there's also one talk from the _Séminaire Henri Cartan_, Volume **9** (1956--57) "Quelques questions de topologie":

- Talk no. 2: "Sur les faisceaux algébriques et les faisceaux analytiques cohérents" (A. Grothendieck).

There is still a lot more to come, and I usually manage to put something out at least once every 10 days or so, so keep your eyes on the site (or [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/tjohnhos)) for more updates (though I'll also post here every once in a while with a summary of the latest translations).
My current plan is to start working through the FGA (slowly); to finish EGA II; to do some of Grothendieck's functional analysis work; and to start a few longer-term translations...
