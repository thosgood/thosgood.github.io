I haven't posted anything here in well over a couple of months, so I thought it'd be a nice idea to just say "hello, I am still here, and here's why I've been too tired to post anything", whence this post.

<!-- more -->

Since defending my thesis in June 2020, I've been bounced all around the place searching for jobs, and finally managed to sort out a very lovely joint position: I'm working with [Artur Ekert](https://www.arturekert.com/) under [CQC](https://www.quantumlah.org/) on creating resources for introductory quantum information science (and so far we've made some [lovely lecture notes](https://thosgood.com/quantum-info)), but I'm based in Oxford, working at the new offices for the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute) (or, at least, I would be, if they weren't currently closed during the lockdown).

What's really nice is that, amidst teaching, [organising a seminar](https://topos.site/topos-colloquium), working on other Topos-related projects, and working with Artur, I've still got _some_ time left over in which I can continue with my research in homotopical complex-analytic geometry.
After lots of conversations with [Mahmoud Zeinalian](https://www.zeinalian.com) (from whom I have learnt a _lot_), it seems like we might try to write something up together, following on from [the sorts of things that I studied in my thesis](https://thosgood.com/blog/2020/03/29/simplicial-chern-weil).
I'm also working on another paper, but I gather that it's not really the done thing to announce such things until they're much closer to completion (which is very sensible, and advice that I would definitely pass on to anybody who asks).
Either way, the point is that I still love thinking about simplicial things, so if you were hoping that I'd write some more about them some day, then hopefully I will! (and also thank you ever so much for caring about what I write).

Oh, and I've taken a little break from working on the [maths dictionary](https://thosgood.com/maths-dictionary), but don't worry: the project is not dead, merely taking a little rest (just like [the EGA translation](https://github.com/ryankeleti/ega)).
However, I've finished [a few more translations](https://thosgood.com/translations), and will hopefully be able to start emptying out the "in progress" list this spring.
