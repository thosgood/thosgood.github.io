Just a very short post (you don't even need to click "Continue reading" if you're looking at this on [thosgood.com/blog](https://thosgood.com/blog/)) --- I finally managed to do some more maths (but only because I had some very hard working and very good coauthors), and I've written about it on the Topos Institute blog: you can see the first blog post [here](https://topos.site/blog/2022/04/diagrammatic-equations-and-multiphysics-part-1/); the second part should be up later this week.

I would love to write more, but after having written these I'm afraid I'm all blogged out for the minute, so ciao for now!
