    <h4 class="mt0">What I'm doing</h4>
    <p class="mt1">
      I have just defended my thesis on the subject of twisting cochains in complex geometry and Chern classes of coherent analytic sheaves at the Université d'Aix-Marseille, and am currently working as part of the <a href="https://damienespadon.wixsite.com/dersympapp">DerSympApp</a> project at the Université de Montpellier.
    </p>
    <p class="mt0">I also work on translating various mathematical articles; see <a href="https://thosgood.com/translations">thosgood.com/translations</a>.</p>

    <h4>What I've done</h4>
    <p class="mt1">I graduated with an MMath (Mathematics) from the University of Oxford in 2016, after having finished my BA in Mathematics there. Whilst there I wrote two theses — both can be found on the <%= link_to('papers', '/papers') %> page.</p>
    <!-- <p>For more details, see my <%= link_to('CV', '/cv') %>.</p> -->
