    <p>After a pretty long time (over two and half years or so), <a
href="https://www.zeinalian.com/">Mahmoud Zeinalian</a> and I have
finished our paper “Simplicial presheaves of Green complexes and
twisting cochains” (arXiv:<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09627">2308.09627</a>). In this blog
post I want to give a brief overview of one of the main technical tools
that we use, which we call <em>Čech totalisation</em>. The full story
involves model categories and homotopy limits and all this sort of
machinery, but the main part of this post will try to keep this to a
minimum, and just talk about a surprisingly useful roundabout way of
describing principal bundles. There might be a second part to this, but
for those interested or wanting for more details I recommend just
delving into the paper — I spent a lot of time trying to make it as
readable as possible!</p>

    <p>I now realise two things: firstly, I haven’t posted anything in
really quite a while; secondly, I should have written this specific blog
post a week ago. Over the past five days, <a
href="https://bryceclarke.github.io">Bryce Clarke</a> and I have been
running the Virtual Double Categories Workshop (a “fun” pun, since the
workshop was entirely online, and there is a notion of a double category
called “virtual”). The speakers were incredible, both in terms of the
talks they gave, in their attitude and enthusiasm for the workshop, and
in the variety of their interests. You can find abstracts, slides, and
recordings of the talks on <a
href="https://bryceclarke.github.io/virtual-double-categories-workshop/">the
workshop webpage</a>, but if you want to hear a bit more about my
personal interest in double categories and how this workshop came about,
then read on.</p>

    <p>For the first time, I have released into the wild a preprint of which
I am the sole author, and had no real supervision. This is a scary
moment indeed — how do I know that I haven’t written complete made-up
nonsense? It’s true that I talked with a couple of close colleagues
about the results, and they nodded in vague agreement, but the
responsibility of checking the actual formal details is all on me. Even
worse, I wanted to include some results about something that I don’t
really have any formal experience with. Anyway, I hope the resulting
paper is at least mildly “good” (whatever that might mean). It’s called
“Various notions of (co)simplicial (pre)sheaves”, and is now on the
arXiv: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15185">2205.15185</a>.</p>

    <p>One thing that the past few years have taught me is that I am not
good at doing maths all by myself. In fact, I would go as far as to say
I am completely useless and unmotivated. I do much better when I have
co-authors to give me deadlines and friends to talk to, but, for obvious
reasons, the past two years have not been good for this. Not really the
ideal time for first postdocs, but alas, that’s life.</p>
<p>I recently found an old notebook with some vague questions and
research ideas in it, and then realised that I have had no motivation to
work on any of these alone, so why not put them out there for other
people to see?</p>

managed to do some more maths (but only because I had some very hard
working and very good coauthors), and I’ve written about it on the Topos

    <p>One of the many reasons that teaching is fun is because you get to
look back at things that you haven’t seen in a while and try to
understand them in light of what you’ve learnt in the meantime. This
means that you sometimes have the unexpected joy of having to teach
something that always used to confuse you, but that now seems so much
more straightforward! I experienced this last year when teaching an
algebraic topology course: I remember being super lost when it came to
the graded ring structure of cohomology and getting very annoyed at
Hatcher’s book; now I look back and realise that it’s really neat! This
post has a slightly different intended audience than normal: I’m just
gonna assume that you know a bit about rings in the first half; the
second half is aimed for somebody who’s a reasonable way through a first
course on algebraic topology (e.g. knows what the cup product in
cohomology is).</p>

    <p>Earlier today, Mahmoud Zeinalian explained something to me that
Dennis Sullivan once explained to him, and it’s been sitting in my brain
ever since then. In an attempt to empty out my thoughts, and also
preserve what little understanding I currently believe to have of the
story, I thought I’d write a little blog post about it. It’s going to
move quite quickly, because I don’t want to spend time developing the
prerequisites — the main purpose is for this to jog my brain two weeks
down the line when I forget all the details!</p>

    <p>Continuing on from last time, let’s now take a look at some actual
computational methods for Lie algebra cohomology, as well as some
applications and important results. We’ll study the cohomology of
semisimple Lie algebras, finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras, and
then take a little detour to talk about the Borel–Weil–Bott theorem.</p>

    <p>As part of a reading group I’m in on Kac–Moody groups (something I
know nothing about), I had to give a talk introducing the basics of Lie
algebra cohomology (something I know very little about), along with some
sort of motivation and intuition, and some worked examples. Since I’ve
written these notes anyway, I figured I might as well put them up on
this blog, and then, when I inevitably forget all I ever once knew, I
can refer back to here.</p>

    <p>Despite being an analytic/algebraic geometer by name (and title, and
qualification, and academic upbringing, and …), there are so many gaps
in my knowledge, even when it comes to simple foundational things. One
thing which I have always tried to do during my academic “career”,
however, is to be the person who asks the first stupid question, so that
others can feel less nervous about asking their (certainly less stupid)
questions. Thus: this blog post.</p>
<p>I am going to explain what I do know, talk about what I don’t, and
then ask some semi-concrete questions that I’m hoping people will be
able to help me out with!</p>

wrote after hearing the phrase “Hochschild homology” for what felt like
the hundredth time, so I thought I’d share them here. They’re not
particularly enlightening, and I can’t claim to add any insight, but I
often use my own blog as a reference for definitions that I once knew

    <p>Having finished my defence (entirely virtually, and hence, of course,
plagued with many technical difficulties), I have now been able to share
my thesis with the world. Most of the technical content can already be
found in my two preprints (<a

href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10591">part II</a>), but I think the
thesis is a much more self-contained and leisurely read, with a lot more
examples and (hopefully) helpful appendices. It also has geese! You can
find a copy of it on <a

<p>Both have been extracted from my PhD thesis (which I’ve just sent off
to the referees) and contain about 90% of the main mathematical content
of my thesis, but with about 90% fewer inane footnotes and digressions.
There are also a few appendices in my thesis which explain the
background of some of the subjects in a bit more detail, which I think
are quite nice, but I’ll probably turn the good ones into blog posts at
some point in the coming months.</p>

    <p>As always, when I haven’t written anything on here in a while, I’m
going to write about something entirely irrelevant to anything I’ve
written about before (instead of continuing any of the many series of
posts I’ve started or planned to start). Today we’re going to look at a
‘fun’ little calculation, which might be the most
algebraic-geometry-like calculation I’ve done in a long time: we’re
going to compute the determinant of the cotangent sheaf of the complex
projective sphere. Note that even the statement of this problem makes me
uneasy: I am nowhere near as comfortable with classical algebraic
geometry as I should be!</p>

    <p>Being unable to ever properly finish any project that I start, but
loving starting new projects, has made getting around to typing up this
blog post quite an effort. Not only that, but it’s also unsatisfying to
me how much I’ve failed to understand the categorical framework behind
my translation project, so it’s mildly intimidating (to say the least)
to present this stuff to the whole internet (although, in actuality,
it’s really just to the one (mabye two) reader(s) of this blog), but I’m
doing so in the hopes that somebody who actually knows about this sort
of applied category theory can help me get somewhat closer to a solid
understanding.</p>

    <p>Finally, I find myself with enough motivation to start writing the
last part to this series. It’s been a while, but hopefully nobody has
actually been waiting… This is where we will finally see some of the
exciting applications of (co)ends, including tensor products, geometric
realisation, and Day convolution. One reason I’ve got around to writing
this post is because coends (or, really, cowedges) appeared to me
recently in a tweet about Stokes’ theorem, which I found pretty neat
indeed — more details can be found in <a

    <p>For category theorists, the idea that “everything is a Kan extension”
is a familiar one, as is the slightly more abstract version “everything
is a (co)end”. For differential geometers, the idea that “everything is
Stokes’ theorem” is sort of the equivalent adage. In an entirely typical
turn of events, it seems that these two seemingly unrelated aphorisms
can be linked together, as I found out today on Twitter.</p>

is very easy, especially as a PhD student, I think, to become
disillusioned with maths, the work that one can do, and academia as a
whole. I realised only the other day, after talking to my family, some
of the things that can contribute towards this. Hopefully this post can
serve as a reminder to myself that I am human being who is trying to be
a mathematician, and not the other way around.</p>

    <p>In my thesis, switching between vector bundles and principal <span
class="math inline">\mathrm{GL}_r</span>-bundles has often made certain
problems easier (or harder) to understand. Due to my innate fear of all
things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal
bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz’s (absolutely fantastic) book
<a href="https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642">Principal
Bundles — The Classical Case</a>, I’ve really grown quite fond of

spaces should be understood as <span

    <p>After some exceptionally enlightening discussions with Eduard Balzin
recently, I’ve made some notes on the links between model categories,
homotopy categories, and localisation, and how they all tie in together.
There’s nothing particularly riveting or original here, but hopefully
these notes can help somebody else who was lost in this mire of
ideas.</p>

    <p>So I’m currently at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn,
Germany, for a conference on ‘Higher algebra and mathematical physics’.
Lots of the talks have gone entirely above my head (reminding me how far
behind my physics education has fallen), but have still been very
interesting.</p>

including some I took at the Derived Algebraic Geometry in Toulouse

    <p>This post assumes that you have seen the construction of derived
categories and maybe the definitions of dg- and <span
class="math inline">A_\infty</span>-categories, and wondered how they
all linked together. In particular, as an undergraduate I was always
confused as to what the difference was between the two steps of
constructing the derived category of chain complexes was: taking
equivalence classes of chain homotopic complexes; and then formally
inverting all quasi-isomorphisms. Both of them seemed to be some sort of
quotienting/equivalence-class-like action, so why not do them at the
same time? What different roles were played by each step?</p>

    <p>Using the idea of weighted limits, defined in the last post, we can
now talk about <strong>ends</strong>. The idea of an end is that, given
some functor <span class="math inline">F\colon
\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</span>, which we
can think of as defining both a left and a right action on <span
class="math inline">\prod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)</span>, we wish to
construct some sort of universal subobject<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
where the two actions coincide. Dually, a motivation behind the
<strong>coend</strong> is in asking for some universal quotient of <span
class="math inline">\coprod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)</span> that
<em>forces</em> the two actions to agree.</p>

    <p>In the previous post of this series, I talked a bit about basic loop
space stuff and how this gave birth to the idea of
‘homotopically-associative algebras’. I’m going to detour slightly from
what I was going to delve into next and speak about
<strong>delooping</strong> for a bit first. Then I’ll introduce
<strong>spectra</strong> as sort of a generalisation of infinite
deloopings. I’ll probably leave the stuff about <span

definitely at least mention about how it ties in to all this stuff.</p>

    <p>I have been reading recently about spectra and their use in defining
cohomology theories. Something that came up quite a lot was the idea of
<strong><span class="math inline">E_\infty</span>-algebras</strong>,
which I knew roughly corresponded to some commutative version of <span
class="math inline">A_\infty</span>-algebras, but beyond that I knew
nothing. After some enlightening discussions with one of my supervisors,
I feel like I’m starting to see how the ideas of spectra, <span
class="math inline">E_\infty</span>-algebras, and operads all fit
together. In an attempt to solidify this understanding and pinpoint any
difficulties, I’m going to try to write up what I ‘understand’ so
far.</p>

    <p>A motto of category theory is that ‘Kan extensions are everywhere’.
As a simplification of this, ‘(co)limits are in a lot of places’. By
rephrasing the definition of a limit we end up with something that looks
invitingly generalisable. This is how we can stumble across the idea of
a <strong>weighted limit</strong>. In this post I’m going to assume that
you are already convinced of the usefulness and omnipresence of limits
and not talk too much (if at all) about why they are interesting in
their own right.</p>
