post over on the Topos blog</a>, but it’s something I’ve been thinking
about a lot, so I wanted to share a link to it here as well. It’s
basically the result of me, knowing a bit about derived categories and
model categories, trying to digest this lovely bit of Australian
category theory by <a href="https://bryceclarke.github.io/">Bryce
Clarke</a> concerning <a

it’s really a fermented and distilled version of an old blog post from

computational methods for Lie algebra cohomology, as well as some
applications and important results. We’ll study the cohomology of
semisimple Lie algebras, finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras, and
then take a little detour to talk about the Borel–Weil–Bott theorem.</p>

    <p>As part of a reading group I’m in on Kac–Moody groups (something I
know nothing about), I had to give a talk introducing the basics of Lie
algebra cohomology (something I know very little about), along with some
sort of motivation and intuition, and some worked examples. Since I’ve
written these notes anyway, I figured I might as well put them up on
this blog, and then, when I inevitably forget all I ever once knew, I
can refer back to here.</p>

    <p>Despite being an analytic/algebraic geometer by name (and title, and
qualification, and academic upbringing, and …), there are so many gaps
in my knowledge, even when it comes to simple foundational things. One
thing which I have always tried to do during my academic “career”,
however, is to be the person who asks the first stupid question, so that
others can feel less nervous about asking their (certainly less stupid)
questions. Thus: this blog post.</p>
<p>I am going to explain what I do know, talk about what I don’t, and
then ask some semi-concrete questions that I’m hoping people will be
able to help me out with!</p>

new of my own to share. I did recently find, however, some notes I once
wrote after hearing the phrase “Hochschild homology” for what felt like
the hundredth time, so I thought I’d share them here. They’re not
particularly enlightening, and I can’t claim to add any insight, but I
often use my own blog as a reference for definitions that I once knew
but later forgot, so this will at least serve that purpose!</p>

    <p>Having finished my defence (entirely virtually, and hence, of course,
plagued with many technical difficulties), I have now been able to share
my thesis with the world. Most of the technical content can already be
found in my two preprints (<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10023">part I</a> and <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10591">part II</a>), but I think the
thesis is a much more self-contained and leisurely read, with a lot more
examples and (hopefully) helpful appendices. It also has geese! You can

    <p><strong>Edit.</strong> <em>I’m in the process of moving over from
YouTube to Vimeo (no ads, less tracking, and no Google), so you can find

<p>This is a very short post just to say that I’ve started uploading
some maths-related videos to my YouTube page. At the moment there’s a
talk I recently gave at a graduate seminar about <a

and curvature from the point of view of somebody trying to avoid
differential geometry</a>, and a series I’ve been working on called <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1-fVcTSjrGSrMHbNcPpdbhNFbCU-FXVL">Nice
Analytic Sheaves For All</a> which aims to discuss motivations for
coherence conditions of complex-analytic sheaves from various points of
view. Hopefully there will be more updates to the latter soon!</p>

    <p>I am a big fan of Stephen Bruce Sontz’s book <a
href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319147642"><em>Principal
bundles: The Classical Case</em></a>, and cannot recommend it enough, as
somebody who usually finds differential geometry (a) dull, and (b)
incomprehensible. Anyway, there’s a lovely quote from this book about
how confusing the terminology surrounding connections can be, so let’s
try to clear some of that up today.</p>

    <p>This week just gone I uploaded two preprints to the arXiv:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10023">Simplicial Chern-Weil
theory for coherent analytic sheaves, part I</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10591">Simplicial Chern-Weil
theory for coherent analytic sheaves, part II</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both have been extracted from my PhD thesis (which I’ve just sent off
to the referees) and contain about 90% of the main mathematical content
of my thesis, but with about 90% fewer inane footnotes and digressions.
There are also a few appendices in my thesis which explain the
background of some of the subjects in a bit more detail, which I think
are quite nice, but I’ll probably turn the good ones into blog posts at
some point in the coming months.</p>
<p>So what are these two papers about? And why is it split into two
parts?</p>

going to write about something entirely irrelevant to anything I’ve
written about before (instead of continuing any of the many series of
posts I’ve started or planned to start). Today we’re going to look at a
‘fun’ little calculation, which might be the most
algebraic-geometry-like calculation I’ve done in a long time: we’re
going to compute the determinant of the cotangent sheaf of the complex
projective sphere. Note that even the statement of this problem makes me
uneasy: I am nowhere near as comfortable with classical algebraic
geometry as I should be!</p>

me how much I’ve failed to understand the categorical framework behind

it’s really just to the one (mabye two) reader(s) of this blog), but I’m

    <p>Finally, I find myself with enough motivation to start writing the
last part to this series. It’s been a while, but hopefully nobody has
actually been waiting… This is where we will finally see some of the
exciting applications of (co)ends, including tensor products, geometric
realisation, and Day convolution. One reason I’ve got around to writing
this post is because coends (or, really, cowedges) appeared to me
recently in a tweet about Stokes’ theorem, which I found pretty neat
indeed — more details can be found in <a

    <p>For category theorists, the idea that “everything is a Kan extension”
is a familiar one, as is the slightly more abstract version “everything
is a (co)end”. For differential geometers, the idea that “everything is
Stokes’ theorem” is sort of the equivalent adage. In an entirely typical
turn of events, it seems that these two seemingly unrelated aphorisms
can be linked together, as I found out today on Twitter.</p>

    <p>I have just come back from CT2019 in Edinburgh, and it was a
fantastic week. There were a bunch of really interesting talks, and I
had a chance to meet some lovely people. I also got to tell people about
<a

and so hopefully that will start to pick up in the not-too-distant

    <p>I haven’t posted anything in a while, and rather than trying to write
about maths, I wanted to just share some lovely photos of Skomer island
(which I recently visited). I am even less knowledgeable about birds
than I am about maths, but I do love them, and this was the first time
in my life that I’d actually seen a puffin in the flesh!</p>

    <p>Having recently been thinking about twisting cochains (a major part
of my thesis) a bit more, I think I better understand one reason why
they are very useful (and why they were first introduced by Bondal and
Kapranov), and that’s in ‘fixing’ a small quirk about dg-categories that
I didn’t quite understand way back when I wrote <a

    <p>In my thesis, switching between vector bundles and principal <span
class="math inline">\mathrm{GL}_r</span>-bundles has often made certain
problems easier (or harder) to understand. Due to my innate fear of all
things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal
bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz’s (absolutely fantastic) book
<a href="https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642">Principal
Bundles — The Classical Case</a>, I’ve really grown quite fond of
bundles, especially when you start talking about all the lovely <span

Point is, I haven’t posted anything in forever, and one of my
supervisor’s strong pedagogical beliefs is that <em>‘affine vector
spaces should be understood as <span

translation’</em>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

discussion, whence this post.</p>

    <p>This post assumes that you have seen the construction of derived
categories and maybe the definitions of dg- and <span
class="math inline">A_\infty</span>-categories, and wondered how they
all linked together. In particular, as an undergraduate I was always
confused as to what the difference was between the two steps of
constructing the derived category of chain complexes was: taking
equivalence classes of chain homotopic complexes; and then formally
inverting all quasi-isomorphisms. Both of them seemed to be some sort of
quotienting/equivalence-class-like action, so why not do them at the
same time? What different roles were played by each step?</p>

    <p>Using the idea of weighted limits, defined in the last post, we can
now talk about <strong>ends</strong>. The idea of an end is that, given
some functor <span class="math inline">F\colon
\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}</span>, which we
can think of as defining both a left and a right action on <span
class="math inline">\prod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)</span>, we wish to
construct some sort of universal subobject<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
where the two actions coincide. Dually, a motivation behind the
<strong>coend</strong> is in asking for some universal quotient of <span
class="math inline">\coprod_{c\in\mathcal{C}}F(c,c)</span> that
<em>forces</em> the two actions to agree.</p>

<strong>spectra</strong> as sort of a generalisation of infinite

    <p>I have been reading recently about spectra and their use in defining
cohomology theories. Something that came up quite a lot was the idea of
<strong><span class="math inline">E_\infty</span>-algebras</strong>,
which I knew roughly corresponded to some commutative version of <span

nothing. After some enlightening discussions with one of my supervisors,
I feel like I’m starting to see how the ideas of spectra, <span

together. In an attempt to solidify this understanding and pinpoint any
difficulties, I’m going to try to write up what I ‘understand’ so

    <p>A motto of category theory is that ‘Kan extensions are everywhere’.
As a simplification of this, ‘(co)limits are in a lot of places’. By
rephrasing the definition of a limit we end up with something that looks
invitingly generalisable. This is how we can stumble across the idea of
a <strong>weighted limit</strong>. In this post I’m going to assume that
you are already convinced of the usefulness and omnipresence of limits
and not talk too much (if at all) about why they are interesting in
their own right.</p>
