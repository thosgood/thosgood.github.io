    <p>I managed to forget to write a blog post for the entirety of 2024 —
wow! Let’s see if I can zip through some things that have happened in
the past 14 months.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>I finished my two-year postdoc position at Stockholm University at
the end of 2023, and then went immediately to <a href="https://oist.jp">OIST</a> in Okinawa for three months as a <a href="https://www.oist.jp/research/research-units/qis/visitors">visitor</a>
to the Quantum Information Security Unit, headed up by <a href="https://www.arturekert.org/">Artur</a>, where I spent most of my
time writing and rewriting various parts of <a href="https://qubit.guide/">qubit.guide</a> in order to get it ready for
print publication, joint with Alastair Kay and Chiara Macchiavello.</p>
<p>After that, I moved back to Oxford (yet again) to teach the quantum
information course again (also gaining student feedback and suggestions
to improve <a href="https://qubit.guide/">qubit.guide</a> even more),
but, on a longer-term scale, to formally join the <a href="https://topos.institute/">Topos Institute</a> as Director of UK
Operations. That’s such a fancy title compared to what I’ve been before,
but my role has essentially been to figure out how to start a partner
institute here in the UK and join in on the community building work
that’s already happening for what might glibly (but also rather
accurately) be described as <em>compassionate applied mathematics</em>.
This is one reason I haven’t been blogging here so much, because I’ve
been writing some posts over at the <a href="https://topos.institute/blog/">Topos Institute blog</a>. One <a href="https://topos.institute/blog/2024-09-06-open-source-curriculum-workshop/">particular
post</a> was about a trip to Kisumu, Kenya, to a workshop on open
curricula and assessment tools for mathematics, which was an absolutely
fantastic workshop, both in terms of topics and attendees. Hopefully
soon I’ll be writing even more about Topos here in the UK, but I’d
rather keep this post short so I can finish it (these days if I take a
break from writing then I almost never find the energy to return).</p>

<p>Another delightful event was organising the <a href="https://bryceclarke.github.io/virtual-double-categories-workshop/">Second
Virtual Workshop on Double Categories</a> with <a href="https://bryceclarke.github.io/">Bryce</a>, following the previous
one that we organised ran in 2022. It’s always a delight to run any sort
of event with Bryce, but the invited speakers, and all the participants,
made it even more delightful again. As a sort of side activity to this,
I have been working on two translations of papers by Charles Ehresmann
that were fundamental in the introduction of double categories, as
suggested by Bryce and Andrée Ehresmann herself: “Catégories doubles et
catégories structurées” (a short note) and “Catégories structurées” (a
much longer paper). The former is finished (<a href="https://translations.thosgood.net/CRAS-256-1963-1198.pdf">[PDF]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/thosgood/translations/blob/main/latex/CRAS-256-1963-1198.tex">[source]</a>)
and I’m about halfway through the latter.</p>
<p>Also on translation, I’ve been invited to speak at a workshop at the
<a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/">Isaac Newton Institute</a> as part
of the <a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/mhm/">Modern History of
Mathematics</a> programme. Here’s a copy of my title and abstract at the
moment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open translations in mathematics.</strong></p>
<p>Translation, in full generality, is a nuanced and complex art form
that requires serious expertise and a holistic approach. So how can we
as mathematicians hope to “solve the problem of translation” in our
domain? Furthermore, can we do so without making access to academia even
harder for non-native English speakers or hurrying a domain collapse of
non-English languages? I believe that the answer to both of these
questions can only possibly be “yes” if we approach translation as a
community-driven activity.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will speak about my experiences in working on large
translation projects with an open-source approach — the technology and
methodology that was helpful for doing so, as well as some of the
difficulties — and describe the sorts of resources that I believe would
have been helpful. Hopefully this can form a starting point for
community thought on the types of projects that we could focus on in the
future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for geometry, I gave a talk at the <a href="https://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~noson/Seminar/index.html">New
York City Category Theory Seminar</a> on “loose simplicial objects”,
which are a generalisation of some simplicial methods that have been
turning up time and time again in the past literature on twisting
cochains, amongst other places. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOpKzfXRl8">My talk</a> wasn’t
very good (I severely ran out of time), but <a href="https://thosgood.net/assets/files/loose-simplicial-objects.pdf">the
slides</a> are available, and hopefully there’ll be a real paper on the
arXiv this year. I’m currently thinking about what Clausen (et al) call
the “modified Hodge conjecture”, but entirely by accident — it just so
happens that the relationship between holomorphic Deligne cohomology and
refined notions of coherent analytic sheaves are two things that have
been surrounding my research for the past eight years now!</p>
<p>I also took up knitting and my mum showed me how to knit a chicken.
It was, like many things, frustrating at times, but very much worth
it.</p>
