<p>This week just gone I uploaded two preprints to the arXiv:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10023">Simplicial Chern-Weil
theory for coherent analytic sheaves, part I</a>;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10591">Simplicial Chern-Weil
theory for coherent analytic sheaves, part II</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both have been extracted from my PhD thesis (which I’ve just sent off
to the referees) and contain about 90% of the main mathematical content
of my thesis, but with about 90% fewer inane footnotes and digressions.
There are also a few appendices in my thesis which explain the
background of some of the subjects in a bit more detail, which I think
are quite nice, but I’ll probably turn the good ones into blog posts at
some point in the coming months.</p>
<p>So what are these two papers about? And why is it split into two
parts?</p>

<h1 id="the-main-goal">The main goal</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>In 1980, H.I. Green wrote their thesis <a href="https://pugwash.lib.warwick.ac.uk/record=b1751746~S1">“Chern
classes for coherent sheaves”</a>, which, as the title so succinctly
implies, gave a construction of Chern classes of coherent (analytic)
sheaves. What was special about this construction, however, was that it
used simplicial methods to mirror the classical Chern-Weil construction
of characteristic classes, which shouldn’t really be possible, at a
first glance.</p>
<p>As a brief recap, for anybody who doesn’t know what some of these
words mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of Chern-Weil theory is that you take a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(vector_bundle)">connection</a></em>
on a vector bundle, calculate its curvature, and then take the trace, to
end up with something that you can show really is a characteristic
class.</li>
<li>Connections are things from differential geometry and Lie theory
that have a <em>lot</em> of interpretations, so just go check out some
other source to learn about these (<a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~goldberg/Notes/AboutConnections.pdf">these
notes</a> are a really nice introduction).</li>
<li>Characteristic classes are classes in cohomology that “describe”
principal <span class="math inline">G</span>-bundles, and common
examples include Chern classes, Stiefel-Whitney classes, Pontryagin
classes, and Euler classes (with each one corresponding to a certain
choice of <span class="math inline">G</span>, roughly). For
homotopy/category theorists, the most familiar construction is probably
that where you look at the generators of the cohomology of <span class="math inline">BG</span> and then pull them back along the unique
map to <span class="math inline">X</span> corresponding to your
principal <span class="math inline">G</span>-bundle.</li>
<li>Coherent sheaves are a type of particularly nice sheaf, and are
somehow analogous to <em>finitely-generated</em> modules. In general,
algebraic geometers like to study a space <span class="math inline">X</span> by studying the category of sheaves on
<span class="math inline">X</span>, and coherent sheaves are some of the
most well behaved. Another very nice type of sheaf is the <em>locally
free</em> sheaf, which is somehow equivalent to a vector bundle, or
principal <span class="math inline">\mathrm{GL}_n</span>-bundle.</li>
<li>The distinction between coherent <em>analytic</em> sheaves and
coherent <em>algebraic</em> sheaves is the distinction between our
ringed spaces: <em>analytic</em> geometry means we study a
complex-analytic manifold with its <span class="math inline">\mathbb{C}^n</span>-induced subspace topology, and
look at holomorphic functions on it; <em>algebraic</em> geometry means
we study a complex-analytic manifold with the Zariski topology, and look
at regular functions on it (and this is where the language of
<em>schemes</em> normally comes into play).</li>
</ul>
<p>So the problem is that Chern-Weil theory doesn’t really work in the
setting that Green was interested in: holomorphic vector bundles on
complex-analytic manifolds <em>rarely</em> have holomorphic connections
(in fact, the first Chern class is exactly the obstruction towards
admitting a global holomorphic connection, and so the moment something
has a non-zero first Chern class, we can’t use this method to calculate
the Chern classes!). Even worse, coherent analytic sheaves do
<em>not</em>, in general, admit resolutions by vector bundles
(i.e. locally free sheaves), unlike coherent <em>algebraic</em> sheaves,
which always do admit such resolutions.</p>
<p>So there are two problems with trying to do Chern-Weil theory on
coherent analytic sheaves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>global holomorphic connections rarely exist, and</li>
<li>coherent analytic sheaves are rarely resolved by locally free
sheaves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Green managed to solve both of these problems by using everybody’s
favourite abstraction of triangles: simplices!</p>
<h1 id="part-i-and-part-ii">Part I and Part II</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>First of all: what have I actually done, except read Green’s thesis
many times over the last three-and-a-bit years? Well, although Green
gives a very explicit construction, he doesn’t really say too much about
why it works, or how to generalise it to get an abstract framework, and
these are the two main points that I’ve tried to work on.</p>
<p>There are two papers because they have different goals: Part I aims
to introduce some definitions about what a simplicial connection should
really be, as well as proving that it satisfies a bunch of nice
properties, and that Green’s construction is a specific example of this
slightly more abstract notion; Part II, on the other hand, is a lot more
hands-on, and applies the abstract nonsense of Part I to show that
Chern-Weil theory ‘works’, as well as showing some calculations (done
‘manually’, without Green’s construction) that are proved to explicitly
agree with what Green gives (but that also contain some extra data: they
are lifts of closed elements in the de Rham complex (i.e. those which
Green constructs) to closed elements in the Čech-de Rham bicomplex).</p>
<p>In a sense, Part I deals with the formalities of the construction,
and Part II shows how it works on vector bundles, which, justified by
some things in Part I, is enough to show us how it works for coherent
analytic sheaves.</p>
<h2 id="simplicial-connections">Simplicial connections</h2>
<p>Building simplicial connections is somehow quite easy, once you get
past all the fiddly notation. Indeed, they are basically connections on
each simplicial degree of a locally free sheaf on the nerve that satisfy
some sort of gluing condition. Of course, we need to define what a
‘locally free sheaf on the nerve’ is, and we do that too — these things
have previously been called <em>simplicial sheaves</em>, but since they
are not simplicial objects in the category of sheaves (I mean, if they
were to be anything, they would be _co_simplicial for a start), I was
pretty careful to give them a less misleading (albeit much less catchy)
name.</p>
<p>Then we can define some particularly nice families simplicial
connections, namely <em>admissible</em> simplicial connections. These
are defined so that we can apply (‘generalised’) invariant polynomials
(such as the trace) to their curvatures and get something well
defined.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an even nicer type of simplicial connection, which
are those that are <em>generated in degree zero</em>. We show that, for
sufficiently nice complexes of locally free sheaves on the nerve, being
generated in degree zero does indeed imply admissibility. This is nice
because simplicial connections that are generated in degree zero are
really <em>so</em> much nicer to work with than arbitrary admissible
ones.</p>
<h2 id="simplicial-resolutions">Simplicial resolutions</h2>
<p>Green used objects called <em>holomorphic twisting resolutions</em>,
pioneered by Toledo and Tong, as well as one of his supervisors
(O’Brian), to construct resolutions of coherent analytic sheaves by
locally free sheaves on the nerve. This can be seen almost as a
strictification result: twisting cochains (the things that make up a
twisting resolution) are the data of a bunch of homotopies that hold up
to higher homotopies that themselves hold up to higher homotopies… and
so on; what Green constructs from such a thing is actually a nice
complex of ‘simplicial sheaves’ that satisfies a bunch of really useful
properties.</p>
<p>What is shown in my thesis (and the Part I preprint) is that we can
lift everything to the level of <span class="math inline">(\infty,1)</span>-categories (presented here by
relative categories and complete Segal spaces, following the work of
Rezk and Barwick &amp; Kan). This is pretty fiddly work, since Green’s
construction is somehow not functorial, but we can get around this. We
also need to be super careful by what we mean when we say ‘a complex of
coherent sheaves’, since, in the <em>algebraic</em> world, this can mean
one of two equivalent things: a (cochain) complex in the category of
coherent sheaves, or a complex in the category of sheaves such that its
internal cohomology (i.e. the cohomology of the cochain complex)
consists of coherent sheaves. In the analytic world, however, these two
things are not necessarily equivalent: we know that they are in low
dimensions, but have no general results (as far as I can tell).
Annoyingly, Green’s construction works on complexes of actually coherent
sheaves, but the category that is really of interest (even in the
analytic world) is the category of complexes with coherent cohomology.
But we can get around this by using some clever argument found in Toën
and Vezzosi’s <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00772955/document">HAG
II</a>, amongst other technical results.</p>
<p>In the end, we can construct an equivalence of <span class="math inline">(\infty,1)</span>-categories that reassures us that,
yes, indeed, coherent sheaves (meaning complexes with coherent
cohomology) are indeed equivalent to sufficiently nice complexes of
locally free sheaves on the nerve endowed with sufficiently nice
simplicial connections, and so we really can apply Chern-Weil.</p>
<h1 id="the-rest">The rest</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>There are some other results and points of view in my thesis that I’d
like to talk about, but I figured that the shorter I keep this post, the
more chance of people actually reading it! Anyway, it’s nice to take a
break from this subject for a little while, and spend some time thinking
about another side project…</p>
