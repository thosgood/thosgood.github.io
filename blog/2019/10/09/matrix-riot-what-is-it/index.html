<p>Anybody who follows me on Twitter will have heard me go on about
Matrix, and Riot, and maybe a whole host of other such things. I
understand that most people probably won’t really care much about it
all, but I thought that I’d try to explain a bit why I’m quite so
passionate about this stuff, and why I’m bothering to try to work on
“LaTeX” support (with scare quotes for good reason, as explained
later).</p>

<h1 id="what-are-matrix-riot-etc.">What are Matrix, Riot, etc.?</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p><strong>tl;dr: Matrix is like email, and Riot is like an email
client.</strong></p>
<p>Anybody who has ever used IRC has some idea of what Matrix is, and
anybody who hasn’t, but has used MSN Messenger/Facebook
Messenger/Slack/WhatsApp has a pretty vague idea too (or at least, will
do, when I explain it a bit).</p>
<p>(As a warning, although I’ve been making small contributions to
Matrix and Riot, I do not work for them, and it has been a very long
time since I worked in any sort of technology sector, so I hope I don’t
mess up any important points too badly. Sorry in advance to any experts
out there.)</p>
<p>Matrix is, at its very heart, <a href="https://matrix.org/">a
<em>specification</em> (or <em>protocol</em>) <em>for
communication</em>.</a> What does this mean? I would explain it to a
mathematician by saying that it is a set of properties that a method of
communication can satisfy, or maybe an axiomatisation of such a system.
This is where it has some similarities to IRC, or even something a bit
more like WhatsApp.</p>
<p>You can think of Matrix as “email” in the following sense. There are
many ways of sending emails, in that you can use any <em>client</em>
that you want to (e.g. GMail, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Mutt, Telnet),
and you can send to and from people with email addresses hosted by
different people (e.g. I, from my <code>posteo.net</code> email address,
can send an email to somebody with an <code>@gmail.com</code> email
address, who can then reply to me and CC in somebody whose email ends
with <code>@yahoo.fr</code>, and so on). But there is some underlying
<em>standard</em> of <em>what an email actually is</em> that all of
these clients and hosts understand and agree to. It’s similar to
whenever you open a webpage in any browser: all of the (people who make
the) browsers (well, almost all…) have <em>agreed</em> on what any piece
of HTML they see should actually mean, and how it should be displayed.
There are lots of subtleties I’m skipping over here, I’m afraid, but
it’s just to motivate the general idea.</p>
<p>So then, what is Riot? <a href="https://riot.im">Riot is a client for
sending messages via Matrix.</a> Further, it’s the “official” client, in
that it’s made by (sort of) the same people who make Matrix. There are
lots of clients out there now, for all sorts of operating systems, and
written in all sorts of different programming languages (and, recently,
one written in about 8 lines of Bash script (rather long lines some of
them, sure, but still…)). All of them (as far as I am aware) are
entirely <em>open source</em>: anybody can go and read any part of the
code, and understand how anything works, and even make suggestions or
additions or fix errors, or even just do some spellchecking on
documentation files; people can help however they want to.</p>
<p>What (to me, at least, but I’m sure to many of the hundreds of
thousands of people who read this blog) is important is that Matrix and,
to take the canonical example, Riot, are built in a way that makes them
pretty much the opposite of other new technologies which we now
sometimes find forced upon ourselves, because everything here is
<em>free, open source, decentralised (but federated), and
secure</em>.</p>
<p>Most of those words are probably pretty self-explanatory, but it’s
worth mentioning the “decentralised (but federated)” bit. This means
that you can go and find an old computer (or even use part of your new
one, if you like) and ‘build’ your very own Matrix Homeserver, which
means that you can now send messages and receive messages to people on
any other homeserver! This is like the fact that you can send emails
from any email host to any other. Imagine what a nightmare it would be
if you could only email people with the same <code>@foo.bar</code> email
address. Unfortunately, this is how most technologies seem to head this
day, because the hope is that everybody will flock to the biggest
platform to be able to speak with the most people.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Slack, and even Telegram and Signal all
have basically this problem: the only way that I can send messages to
somebody on Facebook Messenger is by using Facebook Messenger; I don’t
(really) have a choice of clients, and I don’t have a way of building my
own copy of Facebook messenger that I can use, because this would give
the added bonus of knowing exactly how Facebook Messenger works behind
the scenes.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to happier business. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a
method of communication, like email, where anybody can send messages to
anybody else, irrelevant of what app/program they use, and we all know
exactly what’s happening, down to the goriest details of implementation
if we really want? I think the answer is a pretty firm yes. Bonus points
if things are being run and developed by anybody who wants to help (with
their work ‘peer-reviewed’ by some minimum of people, but also by
anybody else who wants to). Even more bonus points when all the clients
can be open-source, so we can fix any little problems about them that
annoy us, or just make our own for scratch.</p>
<p><em>“But,”</em> one might think, <em>“if everything is out in the
open, then where is my privacy?”</em> To this, there are really two
answers: one to each of the two interpretations of what the questions
might be asking.</p>
<p>Firstly, if anybody is trying to explain why a system that ensures
privacy/security by saying “oh but I can’t tell you the details of how
it works, because then hackers could hack it”, then they are almost
certainly explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">a pretty
insecure system</a>. Good cryptographic algorithms are those where every
single step is read by hundreds of different scientists and developers
and mathematicians, over and over, for 30 years, and everybody agrees
that all the pieces they’ve read (maybe even the whole thing) are good,
and guarantee security in practice for these and those reasons. A good
cryptographic thing is one where you know <em>how</em> it works, but
where this has absolutely no way of telling you how it works
<em>backwards</em>, in some sense.</p>
<p>Secondly, and as an answer to the question that was probably the
intended one, is that Matrix <em>is</em> more secure than how I
described it, because all of your messages can be send with
<em>end-to-end encryption</em>. This is something that, for example,
WhatsApp offers, but they don’t tell us what they do at either “end”,
i.e. before the message has been encrypted and when the message has been
decrypted. For all we know they could be attaching a little something to
your message before decryption, and then quickly sneaking it away to
keep on the other phone just after decoding. Who knows?</p>
<h2 id="so-its-just-like-that-xckd-comic-right">So it’s just like that
XCKD comic, right?</h2>
<p>In almost any conversation, there is a relevant XKCD: here, it’s <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">#927</a> : there are so many competing
standards, so why try for another one?</p>
<figure>
<img src="xkcd927.png" title="XKCD number 927" alt="The XKCD in question">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The XKCD in question</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First of all, as mentioned above, Matrix solves a pretty big problem
by being <em>federated</em>: like email, it doesn’t matter who you
choose to trust (I still use the word “trust” here, because that’s
always something you should think about) to give you your username and
deal with your message sending/receiving (e.g. <code>matrix.org</code>,
<code>matrix.sibnsk.net</code>, or <code>converser.eu</code>), because
you can always send and receive messages from people who made a
different choice. To me, this is just so obvious! Why did we move from
email, and then SMS, to things like chat apps…</p>
<p>But the main reason why I think that Matrix doesn’t really fall afoul
of the (truthfully accurate) problem in this XKCD is that <em>Riot has
bridges</em>. Bridges are ways for people to interact with chat rooms
(or conversations, which are just like two-people chat rooms) in
<em>other apps/programs.</em> That is, <em>without leaving Riot</em>, I
can send and reply to emails, take part in a conversation on Slack, and
message somebody a funny (yet cute) photo of a bird on WhatsApp. So
Matrix is not saying “everybody has to use me”, but instead “anybody who
uses me can also talk to people not using me”.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-you-write-latex-in-scare-quotes">Why do you write “LaTeX”
in scare quotes?</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>What I’ve been working on for a while is trying to find a way to be
able to type formatted maths in messages.</p>
<p>This started off as the naive idea of teaching Riot to understand
KaTeX, MathJax, or MathML, or <em>something</em> “LaTeX-ish”. LaTeX is a
full <em>language</em>, and I just want to be able to message somebody
in a way prettier than typing out raw LaTeX code. A first step, then,
would be to just put a little LaTeX compiler into Riot (something like
LaTeXiT, which I <em>do</em> use for a lot of things, including doing
exactly this (by hand) when I want to have some maths in my email), so
that we can send maths and the viewer can see them as images. This has a
few problems thought, like the fact that we then can’t really just edit
the message after we’ve sent it, because it’s now an image; and also,
LaTeX installations are generally full of a lot of faff (even TinyTeX —
something I personally use and love — has just so many capabilities that
we don’t need, like knowing how to make tables of contents, or to do
page numbering, or margins, or tables, or… any other number of things
that are either not necessary for instant messages, or already possible
to do in much simpler ways): all we really want is to be able to turn
something like</p>
<pre><code>\oiint_{\partial\Sigma}\omega\,\mathrm{d}\tau</code></pre>
<p>into <span class="math inline">\oiint_{\partial\Sigma}\omega\,\mathrm{d}\tau</span>.</p>
<p>So I write “LaTeX” support, because we don’t really want LaTeX, but
instead something like MathJax or KaTeX: something that can just display
LaTeX syntax as nice SVG/HTML content.</p>
<p>But, of course, the project progressed somewhat, and, after having
talked to some very knowledgeable and talented people, some involved in
the same way I am, and some involved by being employees of the
non-profit organisation that helps make Matrix and Riot. The main
consensus now is that, we should <em>not</em> just be asking how to make
Riot display LaTeX syntax as recognisable maths (this is something
that’s easy enough to do that even I did it, having the bare minimum
amount of experience with Javascript: the result is <a href="https://pigeon.digital">https://pigeon.digital</a>); we should be
asking how to deal with the idea of wanting to send mathematical syntax
(that is easy to type) in a way that agrees with Matrix, i.e. how to add
in rules to the Matrix specification that say how mathematical symbols
should be dealt with.</p>
<p>Obviously, for me, this is really exciting, but it’s actually
exciting for other people too, I promise! Hear me out.</p>
<h1 id="why-are-you-telling-me-all-this">Why are you telling me all
this?</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>What people are now trying to do is to come up with a way of sending
“LaTeX” source code (here the square quotes mark the fact that we don’t
want to be able to send arbitrary LaTeX code to be executed, for fair
security reasons) within the Matrix protocol. Then individual clients
can decide how they want to display this. For example, Riot already
knows how to display maths as HTML+CSS using KaTeX, and it can almost,
itself, generate images of the rendered maths to send alongside the
plain text message, so that other clients who <em>can’t</em> turn LaTeX
into something viewable, can use these images as fallbacks instead. It
might even be the case that basically nobody does any “programming”, and
the messages are just sent as plain text, but then the homeservers do
some media magic and accompany the messages with a nice rendered version
of the maths.</p>
<p>What I’m saying, then, analogously, is that we’re trying to find a
way to <em>fit LaTeX syntax into the specifications</em>, which would be
a pretty great thing for mathematicians everywhere! With the rise of
environmentally-conscientious conferences, being able to discuss and
communicate long-distance is becoming increasingly important, and, for
mathematicians, at least, having a way to send messages with nice LaTeX
stuff inside them, could really be a wonderful experience. And not just
that, but also to be able to send such messages to people who <em>aren’t
even using Matrix</em>. Things are much easier when people are all on
the same system, but a good system should never only function in such a
way that it has to be the only one existing.</p>
<p>Finally, I just want to point out what this might mean on a
not-necessarily-smaller-but-maybe-horizontally-located level: there are
still many active IRC chat rooms, most notably, maybe, being the one for
homotopy type theory. At the moment, Riot can bridge to IRC, so a single
room can be at once an IRC room and a Matrix room, but with the Matrix
room supporting things like saving history of conversations that take
place while you’re logged out, and images, file sharing, voice calls,
video calls, E2E encryption, etc. Seeing how nice it is to still have
chat rooms, where you can go and ask a question and get answers (as
opposed to, say, stackexchange/mathoverflow, where you can ask
questions, but all discussions must be moved to a separate thread, and
questions must adhere to a certain structure, etc. etc. (not that I’m
saying that stackexchange is bad, not at all, but just that it is meant
for a different (more rigorous) purpose)), it seems even nicer to me
that we could have ones that have a bit more support for modern things
that we take for granted (images, file sharing, etc., as above).</p>
<h1 id="if-i-do-now-care-what-can-i-do">If I do now care, what can I
do?</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>Well, depending on how you feel, and what you like to do, there are
lots of things that you could do! Here are some suggestions, in no
particular order.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Switch from using Slack/Discord or whatever you currently use, and
give Riot a try. If you don’t like it, maybe ask some questions about if
things can be changed or not. If you decide that you much prefer
Slack/Discord, then go back! (maybe after trying a different Matrix
client, if you’re feeling extra generous — saying “I don’t like Matrix”
because you don’t like Riot is a bit like saying “I don’t like email”
because you don’t like Thunderbird. There are a bunch of Matrix clients,
from Electron-based ones to purely command line ones.) Just please keep
in mind that Riot is <em>open-source</em>: if there’s something missing,
or something broken, or something that you don’t like, then you can just
say so! and if you know how, you can implement/fix/add it! Riot probably
also has most of the things that you are used to: public rooms, private
rooms, one-to-one chats, room bots, and the like.</li>
<li>Join some of the standard Matrix rooms to listen and learn (as well
as to say hello to people and talk)! These are ones like Matrix HQ (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org"><code>#matrix:matrix.org</code></a>)
and Riot Web/Desktop (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#riot-web:matrix.org"><code>#riot-web:matrix.org</code></a>).</li>
<li>If you want to learn more about how Matrix actually works, or about
other clients, or anything at all really, then just ask me (via email,
Twitter, or even Matrix itself!) and I will either answer, or point you
in the direction of somebody who can! If you want to get involved in
these discussions about “LaTeX”, then I can point you to the rooms where
these discussions are taking place.</li>
<li>If you like maths, but have never really used IRC rooms before (or
those chat rooms on stackexchange), or even if you <em>have</em> used
them before, I guess, then why not come and see what they’re like? At
the very least, I can guarantee that they’re super welcoming and never
home to responses like “that’s a stupid question: please do more
research before asking stuff like that here” (although, sure, the caveat
is that they’re very small…). There are currently two maths rooms that I
run (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#math.CT:matrix.org"><code>#math.CT:matrix.org</code></a>
and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#math.AT:matrix.org"><code>#math.AT:matrix.org</code></a>),
and a community that I moderate (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/+mathematics:matrix.org"><code>+mathematics:matrix.org</code></a>),
which keeps a list of interesting rooms to do with mathematics. Don’t
see a room that you’d like to exist? Then make one! You can make it
private and just use it with your local team/work group/reading group;
you can make it public so that anybody can see it; or you can suggest
for it to be added to the Mathematics community list!</li>
