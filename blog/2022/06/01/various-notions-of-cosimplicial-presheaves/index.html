<p>For the first time, I have released into the wild a preprint of which
I am the sole author, and had no real supervision. This is a scary
moment indeed — how do I know that I haven’t written complete made-up
nonsense? It’s true that I talked with a couple of close colleagues
about the results, and they nodded in vague agreement, but the
responsibility of checking the actual formal details is all on me. Even
worse, I wanted to include some results about something that I don’t
really have any formal experience with. Anyway, I hope the resulting
paper is at least mildly “good” (whatever that might mean). It’s called
“Various notions of (co)simplicial (pre)sheaves”, and is now on the
arXiv: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15185">2205.15185</a>.</p>

<h1 id="where-this-paper-came-from">Where this paper came from</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>Ever since my PhD thesis, I’ve been thinking on-and-off about these
things called “sheaves on the Čech nerve”, which were introduced by
Green<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and then later in a different way
by Toledo and Tong<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, in order to do some nice
homotopical construction in complex geometry. The vague idea is that a
sheaf <span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}</span> on a space <span class="math inline">X</span> can be split up into finer parts, with an
individual sheaf <span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}^p</span> for each
simplicial level of the Čech nerve of (a cover of) <span class="math inline">X</span>, i.e. instead of just describing what <span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}</span> looks like on all of <span class="math inline">X</span>, we describe what it looks like on all the
open sets in a cover of <span class="math inline">X</span> (this is
<span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}^0</span>), and then what it looks
like on each pairwise intersection <span class="math inline">U\cap
V</span> of open sets from the cover (this is <span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}^1</span>), and then what it looks like
on each triple-wise intersection <span class="math inline">U\cap V\cap
W</span> of open sets from the cover (this is <span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}^2</span>), and… and so on. One reason
for wanting to do this is that sometimes we want to endow our sheaf
<span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}</span> with some extra structure
or data (such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(vector_bundle)#Formal_definition"><em>Koszul
connection</em></a>, in the case of Green/Toledo–Tong) that might not
exist globally (as is indeed the case for holomorphic connections),
<em>but</em> that exists <em>locally</em> — decomposing our sheaf <span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}</span> into different simplicial levels
over the Čech nerve lets us do exactly this!</p>
<p>Anyway, what always annoyed me about this story (however petty this
might be) was the terminology: a bunch of sheaves <span class="math inline">(\mathcal{F}^p)_{p\in\mathbb{N}}</span> living over
a simplicial space <span class="math inline">(X_p)_{p\in\mathbb{N}}</span> were called
<em>simplicial sheaves</em>, but they’re <em>not</em> simplicial objects
in the category of sheaves on <span class="math inline">X</span>, and,
even worse, they don’t actually really even look very simplicial (the
morphisms all end up going the wrong way, making them look
<em>co</em>simplicial). So is there any relation between these things
(which I gave the uninventive but fairly descriptive name of <em>sheaves
on a simplicial space</em>) and actual simplicial sheaves? Since the
only reference that I know of which actually talks about these sheaves
on simplicial spaces is Green’s aforementioned thesis (and Toledo–Tong’s
aforementioned summary of it), I couldn’t find if anybody else actually
even cared about these objects, let alone cared enough to figure out if
they also deserved the name of “simplicial sheaves”.</p>
<h1 id="an-unexpected-application">An unexpected application</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>When I finally got the motivation to sit down and write things down,
I realised that there was also another pretty large gap in what I knew
about these things: the second thing you normally learn about after
learning about sheaves is <em>sections</em> of a sheaf. So what is a
section of a sheaf on a simplicial space? In one of life’s little
coincidences, when I started thinking about this specific question
seriously, I was working in an office three floors above Vincent
Wang-Maścianica, who patiently helped me to understand the basics of
string diagrams as well as some other stuff that he was working on. The
reason this is a coincidence is because, one afternoon (to mildly
dramatise the story) he saw a diagram on my board and said “oh, I didn’t
realise you were studying X”, to which I replied, “I’m not, I’m thinking
about sections of sheaves on simplicial spaces”, to which we both
replied “oh… interesting”.</p>
<p>The upshot of the ensuing conversations with Vincent left me
reasonably convinced that I could find an application for sheaves on
simplicial spaces outside their one appearance in complex geometry: they
could be used to describe “stuff, stuff relating that stuff, and the
order in which those relations should evolve”. To give a more concrete
example of this, consider the following scenario: we have some objects
<span class="math inline">x_1,\ldots,x_n</span> in a category that has a
nice notion of tensor product (e.g. a symmetric monoidal category), and
we want to understand what endomorphisms of <span class="math inline">x_1\otimes x_2\otimes \ldots\otimes x_n</span> look
like. One way of getting such endomorphisms is to build them up from
smaller endomorphisms! For example, say we have objects <span class="math inline">A</span>, <span class="math inline">B</span>, <span class="math inline">C</span>, and <span class="math inline">D</span>,
and an endomorphism <span class="math inline">f\in\operatorname{End}(A\otimes B)</span> and
another endomorphism <span class="math inline">g\in\operatorname{End}(B\otimes C\otimes D)</span>.
Then we can get an endomorphism on <span class="math inline">A\otimes
B\otimes C\otimes D</span> by composing <span class="math inline">f</span> and <span class="math inline">g</span>,
after extending them by identity morphisms: <span class="math inline">(\mathrm{id}_A\otimes
g)\circ(f\otimes\mathrm{id}_C\otimes\mathrm{id}_D)</span>. But of course
we could have also composed these in the other order, doing <span class="math inline">g</span> first and then <span class="math inline">f</span>, or we could have even picked different
endomorphisms, or we could have had <em>more</em> endomorphisms on
tensor products of <em>different</em> subsets of our objects.</p>
<p>In the paper, I (timidly) make the argument that all of these choices
can be bundled up into one sheaf on a simplicial space, and then that a
single choice of all the data described above corresponds to a
<em>section</em> of this sheaf. There are some caveats in this
construction (for example, the method that I describe requires that we
fix the number and type of endomorphisms beforehand), but I think that
most of them could probably be done away with by somebody who actually
knows something about these very restrictive sorts of string diagrams
(e.g. if there are some “generating” shapes of these diagrams then you
could maybe consider building a simplicial space for each one and then
gluing them altogether with some limit-y process).</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">String diagrams of a certain form
correspond to sections of a specific sheaf on a simplicial
space.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Really, the only reason that I actually include this construction at
all (beyond wanting to make people in another field aware of these
objects that I find so fascinating) is in the hope that somebody comes
along and makes it much better! I think it could be extended to describe
much more general string diagrams, with copies and deletes and whatnot,
but this is not something that I have the knowledge to do on my own.</p>
<p>This application is, I think, not particularly useful, and might just
be an example of “if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks
like a nail”, or even just a tautology (“of <em>course</em> sections of
a sheaf on a simplicial space describe such things — they’re just
objects in the totalisation of the cosimplicial simplicial mapping space
from a cofibrant replacement of a point, and the simplicial nature is
exactly describing the notion of linear order”, or something like this,
says some hypothetical expert), but “hey ho”, thought I, “why not just
write it down anyway — maybe somebody else will also like to think about
such things from this point of view”.</p>
<h1 id="whats-actually-in-the-paper">What’s actually in the paper</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p>The paper is mostly a survey, but contains some proofs of what I’m
calling “pre-folklore results” — results which I think would be folklore
if I’d ever actually heard anybody else care about them!</p>
<p>The first two sections (after the introduction) define three (or
really four) notions of “simplicial sheaf” and describes how they relate
to one another; the next section recalls a technical construction that
shows how to understand this story in the specific setting of (locally)
ringed spaces via a lovely construction<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> of
lax homotopy limits of model categories by Bergner; the final section is
split into two, and contains a summary of the application of sheaves on
simplicial spaces to coherent sheaves in complex geometry, and then this
semi-conjectural construction relating sections of a sheaf on a
simplicial space to string diagrams describing endomorphisms generated
by endomorphisms.</p>
<p>If anybody does actually read this and have any comments,
corrections, criticisms, or complaints, then please do let me know — you
can leave a comment here, or email me, or tweet at me, or whatever you
like. Happy reading!</p>
