<p>One thing that the past few years have taught me is that I am not
good at doing maths all by myself. In fact, I would go as far as to say
I am completely useless and unmotivated. I do much better when I have
co-authors to give me deadlines and friends to talk to, but, for obvious
reasons, the past two years have not been good for this. Not really the
ideal time for first postdocs, but alas, that’s life.</p>
<p>I recently found an old notebook with some vague questions and
research ideas in it, and then realised that I have had no motivation to
work on any of these alone, so why not put them out there for other
people to see?</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>A common fear amongst early-career mathematicians seems to be getting
scooped: having somebody solve the questions you were working on before
you do, maybe even by having read your work and using it as a launchpad.
This is very understandable, since we live in a horrible academic world
where publishing is everything, and trying to publish some results that
you’ve arrived at <em>after</em> somebody else, no matter how shortly or
how differently, suddenly becomes a <em>lot</em> harder, which makes
getting a job next year <em>much</em> more difficult, and… Because of
this, I’ve always been a bit cautious in writing what I’m working on.
But, in the context of my life, the world around me, and some other
things, I realise that these fears aren’t really very well founded for
me right now. There’s no point in me worrying about other people using
my ideas to solve problems before I do if <em>I’m not even working on
applying my ideas myself</em>. Not only that, it’s not like I’m sitting
on some goldmine of potential paths to solutions of big long-standing
open problems — I just have a few small ideas about small things, none
of them are particularly profound or ingenious (in fact, now that I read
back what I’ve written, I see that they’re basically all just “<em>what
if you did X, but with the Čech nerve instead?</em>”). If anything, I
shouldn’t be worried about people scooping my ideas, but the opposite:
trying to get anybody to listen at all!</p>
<p>So I figured I might as well just open up some of<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> my
“research” in the hopes that one of you might see one of the questions I
have and think “oh, that’s interesting, I wonder if Tim would like to
talk about this sometime” (to which I would almost certainly (time and
obligations permitting) answer, “yes, that would be very lovely”).</p>
<h1 id="some-simplicial-things">Some simplicial things</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p><em>(These questions are about using the Čech nerve, and sometimes
the notion of (pre)sheaves on the Čech nerve — cf. e.g. Definition 2.2.1
in “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10023">Simplicial Chern-Weil
theory for coherent analytic sheaves, Part I</a>”.)</em></p>
<h2 id="barycentric-global-sections-always-exist">Barycentric global
sections always exist</h2>
<p>Take a presheaf <span class="math inline">\mathscr{F}</span> (of
<span class="math inline">\mathbb{R}</span>-modules, say) on some space
<span class="math inline">X</span>, and pick a bunch of local sections
<span class="math inline">\{s_i\in\Gamma(U_i,\mathscr{F})\}_{i\in
I}</span>, where <span class="math inline">\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</span> is an
open cover of <span class="math inline">X</span>. Since we only have a
presheaf, there’s no reason for these local sections to glue to give a
global section. <em>But</em> if we pull back our presheaf along the Čech
nerve then we can consider the “barycentric global section” <span class="math inline">\sum_{j=0}^p t_j s_j</span> on any <span class="math inline">U_{\alpha_0\ldots\alpha_p}</span>. This is like the
“uniform average” of all the sections: if we fibre integrate then we’d
get e.g. <span class="math inline">\frac1{p+1}\sum_{i=0}^p
s_{\alpha_j}</span> on each <span class="math inline">U_{\alpha_0\ldots\alpha_p}</span>.</p>
<p>Is this ever useful at all, as a sort of “second best thing” for a
global section that you know doesn’t exist?</p>
<h2 id="čech-nerves-of-things">Čech nerves of things</h2>
<p>Consider some complex-analytic “thing” (i.e. manifold, space,
whatever) <span class="math inline">X</span> that is locally algebraic
(whatever that might mean). If we take the Čech nerve then is the
resulting simplicial “thing” an <em>algebraic</em> simplicial “thing”
<span class="math inline">\widetilde{X}</span>? In the case where <span class="math inline">X</span> is <em>not</em> algebraic, can we measure
how far away it is from being so by looking at the simplicial “thing”
<span class="math inline">\widetilde{X}</span>?</p>
<p>A simpler, similar question: is the Čech nerve of an affine cover of
an (algebraic) scheme an “affine object” in the category of simplicial
schemes?</p>
<p><em>(This last question should be something already well known, but I
just don’t know the answer myself.)</em></p>
<h1 id="some-analytic-geometry">Some analytic geometry</h1>
<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>

<h2 id="chernweil-for-stacks">Chern–Weil for stacks</h2>
<p>One way of cheekily summarising some of the results from <a href="https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02882140">my PhD thesis</a>
would be that “sheaves on the Čech nerve sometimes allow you to apply
smooth methods to complex-analytic things”, and the application of this
that I considered was Chern–Weil theory via the Atiyah exact sequence.
So is it possible to extend some results concerning Chern–Weil theory
via the Atiyah exact sequence on differentiable stacks to the
complex-analytic case?</p>
<p><em>(This question was prompted by seeing two papers on the arXiv by
Indranil Biswas, Saikat Chatterjee, Praphulla Koushik, and Frank
Neumann: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08442"><code>2012.08442</code></a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08447"><code>2012.08447</code></a>.)</em></p>
<h2 id="holomorphic-deligne-cohomology">Holomorphic Deligne
cohomology</h2>
<p>This is one that I’ve been thinking about ever since the middle of my
PhD, and it was actually the original problem that I’d hoped to solve
(but that turned out to be much more difficult than we’d first thought).
Deligne cohomology in the <em>smooth</em> setting is really well
understood — for example, Urs Schreiber has written SO much about this
(and all very very lovely, albeit nearly entirely far over my head)
under the name of <em>differential cohomology</em>. But at some point
quite early on there is a partition of unity argument, which means that
it fails in the holomorphic case. Indeed, there are lots of little
worked examples you can do that show that Deligne cohomology in the
complex-analytic world really is quite different.</p>
<p>One “simple” concrete problem is the following: given a holomorphic
vector bundle (not even an arbitrary coherent analytic sheaf!), write
down <em>Čech representatives</em> for its Chern classes <em>in Deligne
cohomology</em>. Just the first part (Čech representatives) was done<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> in <a href="http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/40592/">Green’s 1980 PhD thesis</a>;
just the second part (holomorphic Deligne cohomology) was done in <a href="http://jgrivaux.perso.math.cnrs.fr/articles/Chern.pdf">Grivaux’s
2009 thesis</a>. There is a (beautiful and very good) paper by Brylinski
and McLaughlin (“<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/communications-in-mathematical-physics/volume-178/issue-1/%C4%8Cech-cocycles-for-characteristic-classes/cmp/1104286562.pdf">Cech
Cocycles for Characteristic Classes</a>”) that seems to give an answer,
but only gives a proof in the smooth setting, and when I sat down (many
<em>many</em> times) and tried to work through it myself, the degrees in
the holomorphic setting seemed to be exactly the wrong ones that you
would get from trying to treat smooth Deligne cohomology like
holomorphic Deligne cohomology (i.e. bidegree <span class="math inline">(2p,0)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">(p,p)</span>, if I remember correctly). It is also
one of those answers where they say “ok, here are all the ingredients
you need, so just put them together”, but then don’t just write down the
explicit representatives (something that always frustrates me: if
putting the pieces together is hard, then say it’s hard; if it’s easy,
then why not just do it?!).</p>
<p>To reduce this problem down to the very simplest form: given a
rank-<span class="math inline">2</span> holomorphic vector bundle
defined by transition functions <span class="math inline">g_{\alpha\beta}</span>, write down a Čech cocycle
<em>in terms of the <span class="math inline">g_{\alpha\beta}</span></em> representing the second
Chern class in <em>Deligne cohomology</em>.</p>
<p><em>(For example, we know how to do this in de Rham cohomology: you
can take <span class="math inline">\operatorname{tr}(\omega_{\alpha\beta}g_{\alpha\beta}\omega_{\beta\gamma}g_{\alpha\beta}^{-1})</span>
or, equivalently (via some algebraic manipulations), <span class="math inline">\operatorname{tr}(\omega_{\alpha\beta}(\omega_{\alpha\gamma}-\omega_{\alpha\beta}))</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\omega_{\alpha\beta}=\operatorname{d}\log
g_{\alpha\beta}=g_{\alpha\beta}^{-1}dg_{\alpha\beta}</span>, and you can
then extend this to give a closed element of the Čech-de Rham
bicomplex.)</em></p>

<a href="#post-title" class="toc-back">↟</a>
<p><em>(More complex-analytic geometry, this time dealing with
holomorphic vector bundles and their generalisations.)</em></p>
<h2 id="complexes-of-coherent-sheaves">Complexes of coherent
sheaves</h2>
<p>If you’re dealing with sheaves in algebraic geometry, then you might
care about whether or not they’re coherent. Given that we like to think
of complexes of sheaves instead of just single sheaves (e.g. we like
working in the derived category), we are interested in the derived
category <span class="math inline">D^\mathrm{b}\mathsf{Coh}(X)</span> of
(bounded) complexes of coherent sheaves. But there’s another category
which arises quite often in practice, namely the category <span class="math inline">D^\mathrm{b}_{\mathsf{Coh}}(\mathsf{Sh}(X))</span>
of complexes of sheaves that are not necessarily coherent, but whose
(internal, i.e. “kernel of the differential of the complex modulo the
image of the differential”) cohomology consists of coherent sheaves. The
latter sounds like it should be more general, but in nice algebraic
cases the two are actually equivalent! This follows from a result in SGA
6:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>SGA 6, II, Corollaire 2.2.2.1.</strong> If <span class="math inline">X</span> is a Noetherian scheme, then the canonical
fully faithful functor <span class="math inline">D^\mathrm{b}(\mathsf{Coh}(X))\hookrightarrow
D(\mathsf{Sh}(X))</span> identifies the codomain with the full
subcategory <span class="math inline">D^\mathrm{b}_{\mathsf{Coh}}(\mathsf{Sh}(X))</span>
of the domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now there’s another related result, which follows from applying the
above corollary to a specific case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>SGA 6, I, Exemples 5.11 (+ II, Corollaire 2.2.2.1).</strong>
If <span class="math inline">X</span> is a smooth scheme, then there is
a canonical equivalence of triangulated categories <span class="math inline">\mathsf{Perf}(X)\xrightarrow{\sim}D^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathsf{Coh}(X))</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This says that, for <em>smooth</em> schemes, pseudo-coherence is
equivalent to perfectness (being <em>locally</em> resolved by locally
free sheaves).</p>
<p>Now, the analogue of this second statement is still true in the
analytic case: coherent analytic sheaves always have <em>local</em>
locally free resolutions. But the first statement is a corollary to
Proposition 2.2.2, which uses the fact that “every quasi-coherent module
is the filtrant colimit of its coherent submodules”, and this is
<em>not</em> true in the analytic case (in fact, this raises a question
I’ll talk about after this one).</p>
<p>So are these two categories, “complexes of coherent sheaves” and
“complexes of sheaves with coherent cohomology” equivalent in the
analytic setting? In the specific case where <span class="math inline">X</span> is a smooth compact analytic
<em>surface</em>, yes! This is Corollary 5.2.2 of Bondal and Van den
Bergh’s “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204218">Generators and
representability of functors in commutative and noncommutative
geometry</a>”. But in higher dimensions, it is (as far as I can tell)
still an open question.</p>
<p>I don’t have any particular insight into this problem, except that I
think (yet again) that sheaves on the nerve might have something to say
about this. Furthermore, I haven’t read the details of Bondal and Van
den Bergh’s proofs, nor those in SGA 6, so probably the following is
obvious (or even tautological, actually), but it’s intriguing that these
hypotheses (<span class="math inline">X</span> is smooth, compact, and a
surface) are exactly those found in Schuster’s “<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/crll.1982.337.159/html">Locally
free resolutions of coherent sheaves on surfaces</a>” which shows that,
under these hypothesis, coherent analytic sheaves can be
<em>globally</em> resolved by locally free sheaves (the <em>resolution
property</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-resolution-property">The resolution property</h2>
<p>Whether or not coherent analytic sheaves can be <em>globally</em>
resolved by locally free sheaves (instead of just <em>locally</em>
resolved) is controlled by the so-called <em>resolution property</em>,
mentioned above. We say that something (e.g. a stack) <em>has the
resolution property</em> if every coherent sheaf admits a surjection
from a locally free sheaf — what happens if we change this to “… a
surjection from a locally free sheaf <em>on the nerve</em>”? This could
be useful for Riemann–Roch for Artin stacks: these have the resolution
property when they are quotients of quasi-projective schemes by
reductive groups, but not in general (and so this assumption appears in
Toën’s Riemann–Roch paper). It could also be useful for a formal GAGA
theorem, cf. Geraschenko and Zureick-Brown’s “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2882">Formal GAGA for good moduli
spaces</a>”.</p>
<h2 id="analogies-between-algebraic-and-analytic-geometry">Analogies
between algebraic and analytic geometry</h2>
<p>Here I’m just going to refer you to a previous blog post of mine: “<a href="https://thosgood.com/blog/2021/09/24/some-questions-about-analytic-geometry">Some
questions about complex-analytic geometry</a>”. The main one here is
“<em>how should we define the notion of quasi-coherence for an analytic
sheaf?</em>”, followed immediately by “<em>why did we pick this
definition, and not the others?</em>”. One possible answer is “read
Scholze and Clausen’s lecture notes on condensed mathematics, Conrad’s
paper on relative ampleness in rigid geometry, and Eschmeier and
Putinar’s book <em>Spectral Decompositions and Analytic Sheaves</em>,
and see if you can put all the pieces together”.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of it, here are some possible contenders for the
definition of quasi-coherence for an analytic sheaf <span class="math inline">\mathscr{F}</span> of <span class="math inline">\mathcal{O}_X</span>-modules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>being <em>of local presentation</em>, i.e. for all <span class="math inline">x\in X</span> there exists an open <span class="math inline">U\subseteq X</span> on which there is an exact
sequence <span class="math display">\mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus I}|U \to
\mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus J}|U \to \mathscr{F}|U \to 0</span>
</li>
<li>being the filtrant colimit of its coherent subsheaves</li>
<li>being <em>Fréchet quasi-coherent</em>, or, equivalently, admitting a
global “topologically free” resolution</li>
<li>something analogous to arising from the right Kan extension of
something like the pseudofunctor <span class="math inline">\mathsf{CRing}\to\mathsf{Cat}</span> defined by
<span class="math inline">R\mapsto\mathsf{Mod}_R</span> (very vague, I
know).</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that there are <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2840594/gaga-and-quasicoherent-sheaf/2841087#2841087">examples
of 1. that do not satisfy 2.</a>, but I actually don’t know how the
other notions interact at all.</p>
