    <p>After a pretty long time (over two and half years or so), <a
href="https://www.zeinalian.com/">Mahmoud Zeinalian</a> and I have
finished our paper “Simplicial presheaves of Green complexes and
twisting cochains” (arXiv:<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09627">2308.09627</a>). In this blog
post I want to give a brief overview of one of the main technical tools
that we use, which we call <em>Čech totalisation</em>. The full story
involves model categories and homotopy limits and all this sort of
machinery, but the main part of this post will try to keep this to a
minimum, and just talk about a surprisingly useful roundabout way of
describing principal bundles. There might be a second part to this, but
for those interested or wanting for more details I recommend just
delving into the paper — I spent a lot of time trying to make it as
readable as possible!</p>

    <p>One of the many reasons that teaching is fun is because you get to
look back at things that you haven’t seen in a while and try to
understand them in light of what you’ve learnt in the meantime. This
means that you sometimes have the unexpected joy of having to teach
something that always used to confuse you, but that now seems so much
more straightforward! I experienced this last year when teaching an
algebraic topology course: I remember being super lost when it came to
the graded ring structure of cohomology and getting very annoyed at
Hatcher’s book; now I look back and realise that it’s really neat! This
post has a slightly different intended audience than normal: I’m just
gonna assume that you know a bit about rings in the first half; the
second half is aimed for somebody who’s a reasonable way through a first
course on algebraic topology (e.g. knows what the cup product in
cohomology is).</p>

    <p>Earlier today, Mahmoud Zeinalian explained something to me that
Dennis Sullivan once explained to him, and it’s been sitting in my brain
ever since then. In an attempt to empty out my thoughts, and also
preserve what little understanding I currently believe to have of the
story, I thought I’d write a little blog post about it. It’s going to
move quite quickly, because I don’t want to spend time developing the
prerequisites — the main purpose is for this to jog my brain two weeks
down the line when I forget all the details!</p>

    <p>Once again I feel the urge to type something nice, but have nothing
new of my own to share. I did recently find, however, some notes I once
wrote after hearing the phrase “Hochschild homology” for what felt like
the hundredth time, so I thought I’d share them here. They’re not
particularly enlightening, and I can’t claim to add any insight, but I
often use my own blog as a reference for definitions that I once knew
but later forgot, so this will at least serve that purpose!</p>

    <p>This week was the <a href="https://ytm2019.epfl.ch">Young Topologists
Meeting</a> at EPFL in Lausanne, and had courses by Julie Bergner (on 1-
and 2-Segal spaces) and Vidit Nanda (on the topology of data), as well
as a bunch of great talks by various postdocs and PhD students. I was
lucky enough to get the chance to talk about twisting cochains and
twisted complexes for half an hour, and you can find the slides <a

    <p>In my thesis, switching between vector bundles and principal <span
class="math inline">\mathrm{GL}_r</span>-bundles has often made certain
problems easier (or harder) to understand. Due to my innate fear of all
things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal
bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz’s (absolutely fantastic) book
<a href="https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642">Principal
Bundles — The Classical Case</a>, I’ve really grown quite fond of
bundles, especially when you start talking about all the lovely <span
class="math inline">\mathbb{B}G</span> and <span
class="math inline">\mathbb{E}G</span> things therein<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Point is, I haven’t posted anything in forever, and one of my
supervisor’s strong pedagogical beliefs is that <em>‘affine vector
spaces should be understood as <span
class="math inline">G</span>-torsors, where <span
class="math inline">G</span> is the underlying vector space acting via
translation’</em>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which makes a nice short topic of
discussion, whence this post.</p>

    <p>In the previous post of this series, I talked a bit about basic loop
space stuff and how this gave birth to the idea of
‘homotopically-associative algebras’. I’m going to detour slightly from
what I was going to delve into next and speak about
<strong>delooping</strong> for a bit first. Then I’ll introduce
<strong>spectra</strong> as sort of a generalisation of infinite
deloopings. I’ll probably leave the stuff about <span
class="math inline">E_\infty</span>-algebras for another post, but will
definitely at least mention about how it ties in to all this stuff.</p>

    <p>I have been reading recently about spectra and their use in defining
cohomology theories. Something that came up quite a lot was the idea of
<strong><span class="math inline">E_\infty</span>-algebras</strong>,
which I knew roughly corresponded to some commutative version of <span
class="math inline">A_\infty</span>-algebras, but beyond that I knew
nothing. After some enlightening discussions with one of my supervisors,
I feel like I’m starting to see how the ideas of spectra, <span
class="math inline">E_\infty</span>-algebras, and operads all fit
together. In an attempt to solidify this understanding and pinpoint any
difficulties, I’m going to try to write up what I ‘understand’ so
far.</p>
